The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2015 annual report for this blog. [![](//s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2014-emailteaser.png)](http://cuoilennaocacban2.wordpress.com/2015/annual-report/) Here's an excerpt:

> The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about **13,000** times in 2015. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 5 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.
