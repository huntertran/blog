# 1\. MAIN TOPIC

Today's Main Topic is Hour of Code!

## Japan: MSP Japan joined Hour of Code

 On Dec 12th, 2014, one of the events for the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/jp) by MSPs was carried out with 36 young students who ranged from 15 to 18 of ages at an all girls' high school in Tokyo. In collaboration with Life is Tech! Microsoft Japan provided the technologies and MSPs helped students write codes as a mentor. Through the event, students learned and developed the programming skills so fast to make an app on time and no one gave up, which made us surprised. From this experience, we now believe the importance for any learner, especially for beginners, to let them have easy access to the first steps with fun and excitement.

## New Zealand: The Microsoft Student Accelerator Initiative

 2014 has been a hectic but rewarding year for MSP New Zealand! The MSPs, along with Ryan Tarak (BDE, DX, Microsoft New Zealand), launched a brand new initiative called the Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA). The MSA program aims to train students from all around the country on Microsoft technologies and better prepare them for the tech industry of today. The biggest benefit of the program is the placement of qualifying students with New Zealand's biggest employers in the tech industry so they can gain work experience over the summer.

While 600 students trained in the first phase of the program, around 200 students moved on to complete phase 2 and finally, 94 students were placed with employers after rigorous individual and group assessments. A total of 35 employers participated in the program, including the University of Auckland (largest university in New Zealand), Coca-Cola, Lazyworm Apps (developers of MetroTube), Datacom and a few government organizations.  For more information, check out [http://aka.ms/MSAInfograph](http://aka.ms/MSAInfograph).

## Philippines: one of the top countries in the "Hour of Code" global leaderboards

In  the celebration of the 2014  Computer Science Education Week (December 8-14), though Hour of Code is not a competition, the  Philippines  is one of the  top countries in the  Hour of Code Global Leaderboards  for having one of the highest participation rates in Hour of Code activities, with a total of  112 events  as of today, January 11, 2015.

Though some of the events were rescheduled due to impending Typhoon Hagupit, that didn't stop the teams from accomplishing their goal of teaching K-12 students and others from non-tech colleges how to code.
