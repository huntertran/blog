This type allow you to define a set of named values that have underlying values, usually numeric ones. In this post, we will discuss on how to extent this type to store more data, and use them in a simple Angular select list. Enum in different languagesIn TypeScript, you can set enum value to a string export enum Color &#123; Red = &#x27;red&#x27;, Green = &#x27;green&#x27;, Blue = &#x27;blue&#x27; &#125; You can also get value of the enum by a function. Head here for more info. But be careful while using these. This is pretty wild, and prone to cause problems when the project get larger, and multiple devs joined. Enum in TypeScript is different from most of the other programming languages, where you can only set value of enum with numeric values like int, uint, long, etc. What if you want to include more data into your enum. In the above example, how can you add the hex color code, along side with a short description? The Enum patternSimply put, you can declare your enum as a class with static property, then use them as a normal enum // for TypeScript export class Color &#123; public static Red = new Color(1, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;#FF0000&quot;, &quot;A vibrant, bold, and attention-grabbing color&quot;); public static Green = new Color(2, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;#00FF00&quot;, &quot;A calming, soothing, and trustworthy color.&quot;); public static Blue = new Color(3, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;#0000FF&quot;, &quot;A fresh, natural, and balancing color.&quot;); public get Id(): number &#123; return this.id; &#125; public get Name(): string &#123; return this.name; &#125; public get Hex(): string &#123; return this.hex; &#125; public get Description(): string &#123; return this.description; &#125; constructor(private id: number, private name: string, private hex: string, private description: string) &#123; &#125; &#125; When you want to use it, you need to include the property you want to get let color: Color = Color.Red; console.log(color.Description); // A vibrant, bold, and attention-grabbing color In C#, the code is a little bit more complicated, and covered in this excellent article: Use enumeration classes instead of enum types That’s all for today.

But this option is not as simple as it seems. Let’s walk through the ideas, and the logic behind it. 1. The idea of Select AllYou’ve got an email. It is a spam mail from an online store that you’ve never heard of. The other 50 mails in your inbox is the same. You want to delete all of them. Selecting each of these email is taking too much time. Luckily, we all familiar with that Select all checkbox on top 2. The complication behind Select AllHow can something as simple as a select all option can get complicated? Because we didn’t know what is the expectation of the users. Everyone has their own ideas and expectation on how a certain function works. So what are the expectation of Select All function? Does the Select All has 3 states? Checked - Unchecked - Intermediate (between checked and unchecked) If there are multiple pages of item, does the item on other pages affected too? If there are only 1 item in the list, do you need to show the select all option? Also, there is some other expectations, from the point of view of a developer Is Select All option an option from the data? If it is a special option and not present in the data, should it be styled the same way as other option? Should you put the Select All option on the top of the list Obviously, the below implementation of select all in Angular doesn’t looks good From this StackBlitz Each of these expectation add some complication to the existing code. For some points, you would need to change the model of the data as well to support it. 3. What user expected from Select AllAs a developer, I would like to give my users an adequate amount of information, not too little (so they would need to infer), not too much (so they would lost in all the non-necessary information). Here is my list Has 3 states If all items selected: Checked If some items selected: Intermediate If no items selected: Unchecked Only affect the current page Will notify user that only items of the current page are selected. Provide a way to select all item Hide if there is only n items in the list. n could be 1, 2, or 5 On top of the list, and sticky too 4. Implementation logic4.1. Approach 1: Select All as an option in dataMeaning that you have a list, let’s say Steak, Pizza, and Tacos. The Select All would be an item in that list too. Pros: Implementation once, reuse as many as you like (if your language of choice support inheritance) No need to special care on styling. The option is rendered just like a regular item Cons: Show&#x2F;Hide it could be a problem Extra noise&#x2F;pollution in the model class May not be able to use the built-in interation to loop through items 4.2. Approach 2: Select All as an special option in the viewMeaning that when render the view, you “inject” the select all option and it’s logic Pros: Pure data model You can customize the behavior Cons: You need to style the option to match with other item (could not be a problem if you use the default style) Need to re-implement for each list (could be a lot of work) May hit on performance (the state of the Select all checkbox depend on the state of all other items) I’m sure that there are other hidden problem with each approach, depending on the frontend framework you’re using, the data you’re handling, and a bunch of other things that not in the picture yet. Choose wisely, my fellow developers","categories":[{"name":"UI","slug":"UI","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/UI/"}],"tags":[{"name":"ui","slug":"ui","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/ui/"}]},{"title":"XAML for beginner - Part 2","slug":"XAML-for-beginner-Part-2","date":"2023-06-25T14:31:36.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.570Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/06/25/XAML-for-beginner-Part-2/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2023/06/25/XAML-for-beginner-Part-2/","excerpt":"This is part 2 of post “XAML for beginner”. In this part, I will introduce the list control: ListBox, GridView. Also included a super short introduction to MVVM and data binding in XAML.","text":"This is part 2 of post “XAML for beginner”. In this part, I will introduce the list control: ListBox, GridView. Also included a super short introduction to MVVM and data binding in XAML. 1. ListBox controlListBox allows you to display a list of item. Each item in the list box would have the same type, with the same UI. For example, “top 30 most stream songs on Spotify” is a kind of data that we could use ListBox to display. 1.1. ListBox property: ItemsSourceItemsSource is the source for the items that you want to display on the UI. ItemsSource can be a object of type List, or type ObservableCollection. We will talk a bit about this property in DataBinding section 1.2. ListBox property: SelectedIndex and SelectedItemWhen user select an item on the list box, both SelectedIndex and SelectedItem property will be updated with the corresponding data. The index is start from 0. 2. DataBindingIf you familiar with Angular, React, or Vuejs, you probably know what is data binding. In short, the data you have in memory will automatically displayed on UI. If the data got updated (by calculation, replaced from a call to API, user changed it), the UI will update the view as well. There are 3 types of DataBinding, which is One time binding, One way binding and Two way binding In One time binding, the data got prepared, then send to the UI one time only, usually when you load the view. In One way binding, whenever the data updated in memory, the UI will update it view too. But when the data on UI updated (think of the user modify the data in a text box), the data in memory is not getting updated. In Two way binding, the data between UI and memory are kept in sync. 2.1. Design Pattern for DataBinding - MVVM This is optional, there are multiple way for you to “bind” the data with UI. Microsoft invented and advocated for the MVVM pattern. They support this pattern and use it everywhere in there newer first-party applications, especially the one that you can download from Windows Store (WPF, UWP apps) MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel. This pattern is a variation of Martin Flower’s Presentation design pattern. In short, Model is the model classes that define your data. In the Spotify example above, the model class could be like this: public class Song &#123; // simplified for the blog post public int Id &#123; get; set; &#125; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; public DateTime DatePublished &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; ViewModel is a special class that was use as a converter. It converts the data in model into something that can be displayed on screen. On the ViewModel class, you would need to handle the update mechanism of the data you have in Model to View. In other to do this, the Model would need to implement the interface INotifyPropertyChanged, or INotifyCollectionChanged. INotifyPropertyChanged is for update the property of the model. INotifyCollectionChanged is for update the list if you add&#x2F;remove&#x2F;re-arrange the item in the list. ObservableCollection already implemented the INotifyCollectionChanged for you. Using the same Spotify example, the ViewModel would be something like this public class MainViewModel &#123; public ObservableCollection&lt;Song&gt; SongList &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; Now you just need to populate the data for your song list, and put that in DataContext of the MainWindow.xaml page 2.2. DataContextDataContext is the way you tell the page which data to display on UI. You can set the data context by assigning the DataContext property of Window or Page. The code for the MainWindow.xaml.cs should look like this: public partial class MainWindow : Window &#123; public MainViewModel MainVm = new MainViewModel(); public MainWindow() &#123; // Here I set the Window&#x27;s data context DataContext = MainVm; MainVm.SongList = new ObservableCollection&lt;Song&gt; &#123; new Song(1, &quot;Test 1&quot;, DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(1)), new Song(2, &quot;Test 2&quot;, DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(2)), new Song(3, &quot;Test 3&quot;, DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(3)), new Song(4, &quot;Test 4&quot;, DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(4)) &#125;; InitializeComponent(); &#125; &#125; 2.3. ItemTemplate of ListBoxYou would need to declare a “template” for your data in ListBox. This is called ItemTemplate. Modify your XAML code as follow: &lt;ListBox ItemsSource=&quot;&#123;Binding SongList&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt; &lt;DataTemplate&gt; &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=&quot;20&quot; /&gt; &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=&quot;*&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;5*&quot; /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;5*&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; Grid.RowSpan=&quot;2&quot; Grid.Column=&quot;0&quot; Text=&quot;&#123;Binding Id&#125;&quot; /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; Grid.Column=&quot;1&quot; Text=&quot;&#123;Binding Name&#125;&quot; /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; Grid.Column=&quot;1&quot; Text=&quot;&#123;Binding DatePublished&#125;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt; &lt;/ListBox&gt; In this xaml, we set ItemsSource=&#123;Binding SongList&#125;, which is the name of the property in the MainViewModel class. Later, we bind each TextBlock to the property of Song class. Now if you run the application, you should see something like this: It’s ugly, but hey it worked ;) GridView view modeGridView displays data as a table, with headers and rows. You would need to use GridView with ListView control, in View property &lt;ListView ItemsSource=&quot;&#123;Binding SongList&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;ListView.View&gt; &lt;GridView AllowsColumnReorder=&quot;true&quot; ColumnHeaderToolTip=&quot;Song list&quot;&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;&#123;Binding Id&#125;&quot; Header=&quot;ID&quot; /&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;&#123;Binding Name&#125;&quot; Header=&quot;Name&quot; /&gt; &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;&#123;Binding DatePublished&#125;&quot; Header=&quot;Published date&quot; /&gt; &lt;/GridView&gt; &lt;/ListView.View&gt; &lt;/ListView&gt; Run the application, then you will see something like this: Source CodeSource code for this whole sample is available at: SampleWPF on Github I hope you can learn something new about XAML today.

Could you guess which language they use to develop apps for these shiny new phones? It’s XAML. In this post, I will introduce the most basic concept of XAML layout, as well as how to use them in your personal project. 1. Two lines on History of XAMLXAML, aka Extensible Application Markup Language, was a nice replacement for Windows Form. Later, it was used for Windows Phone, Universal Windows Platform apps (the apps that run on Windows 8 and above). 2. Basic controls - GridIn XAML, there are some basic controls that was use as a container for other controls, which is Grid, StackPanel, and ScrollViewer. I will cover the ScrollViewer at the end of this post. A comparison as follow: Grid StackPanel The inner controls can overlap with each other Inner controls stack horizontally or vertically Inner controls can be arranged based on row and columns N&#x2F;A The grid can be expanded to parent control The StackPanel expands based on the inner content&#x2F;controls Let’s start with a sample WPF application. Open the file Window.xaml in your Visual Studio. Inside the outer Grid, add two TextBlock as follow: &lt;Window x:Class=&quot;WpfApp1.Window1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&quot; xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot; xmlns:d=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008&quot; xmlns:mc=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006&quot; xmlns:local=&quot;clr-namespace:WpfApp1&quot; mc:Ignorable=&quot;d&quot; Title=&quot;Window1&quot; Height=&quot;800&quot; Width=&quot;480&quot;&gt; &lt;Grid Background=&quot;Transparent&quot;&gt; &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;Hello world&quot; FontSize=&quot;50&quot;/&gt; &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;Hello WPF&quot; FontSize=&quot;80&quot;/&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; &lt;/Window&gt; You will receive a layout with overlapped texts like this Overlapping contents allow you to design more sophisticated&#x2F;beautiful app, for example: 2.1. Grid’s column and rowGrid allows you to arrange the content into columns and row. You can declare column definitions and row definitions. After that, for each child control, you can set column or row property. &lt;Grid Background=&quot;Transparent&quot;&gt; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;60&quot; /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;80&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; FontSize=&quot;50&quot; Text=&quot;Hello world&quot; /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; FontSize=&quot;80&quot; Text=&quot;Hello WPF&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; The textblocks are now arranged to rows accordingly You can do the same for columns, or combine the rows and columns to have a table like layout 2.2. Row and column sizeIf you’re a web developers, at some point, you would need to scratch your head on how to make this div take up the whole space, or make it fit the contents, etc. TBH, it was never an easy task, consider that you might have a dozen of nested elements acts as the containers for the div element that you want to display on the screen. Luckily, XAML solved this problem by 3 simple concept for height of rows and width of columns: Fixed size: The width&#x2F;height is exactly what you declared Auto: The width&#x2F;height is equal to the width&#x2F;height of the content inside it Star: The width&#x2F;height is expand to fit the remaining space of the parent control Number with star: Act as percentage. Useful for scaling Let’s see them in action. The following code will give this layout &lt;Grid Background=&quot;Transparent&quot;&gt; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;60&quot; /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;3*&quot; /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;7*&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; FontSize=&quot;15&quot; Text=&quot;Hello world&quot; /&gt; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; FontSize=&quot;80&quot; Text=&quot;Hello WPF&quot; /&gt; &lt;Grid Grid.Row=&quot;2&quot; Background=&quot;Green&quot; /&gt; &lt;Grid Grid.Row=&quot;3&quot; Background=&quot;Blue&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; Obviously, you can nest multiple Grid in a parent Grid 3. Basic control - StackPanelStackPanel, as the name of the control, stack the content horizontally or vertically. &lt;Grid Background=&quot;Transparent&quot;&gt; &lt;StackPanel Margin=&quot;16&quot;&gt; &lt;Grid Width=&quot;80&quot; Height=&quot;40&quot; Background=&quot;Red&quot; /&gt; &lt;Grid Width=&quot;160&quot; Height=&quot;40&quot; Background=&quot;Blue&quot; /&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; By default, StackPanel is vertical You can make it Horizontal by set the Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot; 4. Basic control - ScrollViewerScrollViewer allow you to scroll the content that overflow the screensize. This apply to both horizontal and vertical size &lt;Grid Background=&quot;Transparent&quot;&gt; &lt;ScrollViewer&gt; &lt;StackPanel&gt; &lt;Grid Width=&quot;80&quot; Height=&quot;40&quot; Background=&quot;Red&quot; /&gt; &lt;Grid Width=&quot;160&quot; Height=&quot;40&quot; Background=&quot;Blue&quot; /&gt; &lt;Grid Width=&quot;160&quot; Height=&quot;400&quot; Background=&quot;Green&quot; /&gt; &lt;Grid Width=&quot;160&quot; Height=&quot;800&quot; Background=&quot;Violet&quot; /&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt; &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt;","categories":[{"name":"XAML","slug":"XAML","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/XAML/"}],"tags":[{"name":"XAML","slug":"XAML","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/XAML/"},{"name":"Windows Store App","slug":"Windows-Store-App","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Windows-Store-App/"}]},{"title":"Optimize list of bool values in C#","slug":"Optimize-list-of-bool-values-in-C","date":"2022-04-24T00:47:44.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.570Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/24/Optimize-list-of-bool-values-in-C/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2022/04/24/Optimize-list-of-bool-values-in-C/","excerpt":"Boolean data type represents the true&#x2F;false value.

The basic - Using bit to store multiple booleans 1.1. Hotel example 1.2. Bitwise operation comes to the rescue 1.3. Storing booleans 1.4. Retrieving booleans 2. FlagsAttribute in C# - They already did it for you 2.1. Storing data 2.2. Retrieving data 3. Mind the limit of int 4. Flatten the value 1. The basic - Using bit to store multiple booleans 1.1. Hotel example Let’s jump into an example. It’s summer here in Montréal, and you want to book a hotel there for travel. The hotel’s rooms have multiple amenities. Some rooms have a TV; others have an oven, etc. Naturally, when representing these rooms in the database, we would need some boolean values (or bit data type in SQL). The class should look like this: public class Room &#123; public int RoomNumber &#123; get; set; &#125; public bool HasTV &#123; get; set; &#125; public bool HasMicrowave &#123; get; set; &#125; public bool HasOven &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; All good if your hotel’s room only has that three amenities. What if the room has 10, 30, or even 100 amenities? Store each of them in a new bool property? How about the database? Suddenly, the manager wants to add a new amenity: A face mask dispenser. How would you deal with it? Would you add a new column in the database, a new property in the class, etc? 1.2. Bitwise operation comes to the rescue We all know that: AND operator 0 &amp; 0 =&gt; 0 0 &amp; 1 =&gt; 0 OR operator 0 | 0 =&gt; 0 0 | 1 =&gt; 1 We can exploit these bitwise to store our boolean values. First, we set up an enum class. Notice the value of enum is the power of 2 public enum Facility &#123; None = 0, HasTV = 1, HasMicrowave = 2, HasOven = 4, &#125; By doing this, when storing enum, these values will have the binary as follow: None = 000 HasTV = 001 HasMicrowave = 010 HasOven = 100 The 1 character is in a different location on each value. When applying the AND or OR bitwise operator on these values, the combined value will have the 0 or 1 placed in the exact location. For example: HasTV 001 | HasMicrowave 010 &lt;-- OR operator ----------------------- 011 &lt;-- equal to 3 in decimal We can store all the booleans in a single int value using this. The AND operator with the targeted value will replace with 1 character with 0: value 011 &lt;-- 3 in decimal, from above &amp; HasTV 001 &lt;-- AND operator ----------------------- Has TV? 001 &lt;-- equal to enum value 1: HasTV value 011 &lt;-- 3 in decimal &amp; HasMicrowave 010 &lt;-- AND operator ----------------------- Has microwave? 010 &lt;-- equal to enum value 2: HasMicrowave How about HasOven? value 011 &lt;-- 3 in decimal &amp; HasOven 100 &lt;-- AND operator ----------------------- Has oven? 000 &lt;-- equal to enum value 0: None 1.3. Storing booleans As you can guess, storing booleans is doing an OR operator on the values. var facilities = Facility.HasTV | Facility.HasMicrowave; // facilities = 3 1.4. Retrieving booleans To retrieve the bool values, we can do AND operator with the targeted enum and test if the result &gt; 0 var isHasTV = (facilities &amp; Facility.HasTV) &gt; 0 ? true : false; 2. FlagsAttribute in C# - They already did it for you To make life easier for developers, Microsoft has a FlagsAttribute that you can decorate your enum. This will indicates that an enumeration can be treated as a bit field; that is, a set of flags. [Flags] public enum Facility &#123; None = 0, HasTV = 1, HasMicrowave = 2, HasOven = 4, &#125; 2.1. Storing data Using the same OR bitwise operator to store the data var roomFacility = Facility.HasTV | Facility.HasMicrowave; 2.2. Retrieving data Use HasFlag method to retrieve data var hasTV = roomFacility.HasFlag(Facility.HasTV); // hasTV = true 3. Mind the limit of int There are 4 data type you can use to store int value in SQL Server: Data type Range Storage bigint -2^63 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808) to 2^63-1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807) 8 Bytes int -2^31 (-2,147,483,648) to 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647) 4 Bytes smallint -2^15 (-32,768) to 2^15-1 (32,767) 2 Bytes tinyint 0 to 255 1 Byte 8 bits &#x3D; 1 byte. So for 1 byte of storage, you can store up to 8 boolean values (theoretically). The default int primitive type in C# is 32 bits or 4 bytes What if you want to store more than 32 boolean values? In this case, I would strongly recommend you to re-design your class and data structure to split it into smaller ones 4. Flatten the value What if you want to flatten the boolean values compressed into a flat class with actual bool properties? Of course you can do it with HasFlag() method, and a bunch of if statements. However, writing if 10 times in a row is not very maintainable. Luckily we have reflection, a way to read the class meta data. First, we need to create a new attribute class (full source code with comment here): [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property, AllowMultiple = false)] public class FlattenedFlagAttribute : Attribute &#123; public Enum enumProperty; public FlattenedFlagAttribute(Facility facility) &#123; this.enumProperty = facility; &#125; // This method allow us &quot;flatten&quot; the compacted data into the property which is decorated with the same Facility data type public static void Flatten(object o, Enum enumData) &#123; var props = o.GetType().GetProperties(); foreach (var prop in props) &#123; var attr = prop.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(FlattenedFlagAttribute), false); if (attr.GetLength(0) &gt; 0) &#123; prop.SetValue(o, enumData.HasFlag(((FlattenedFlagAttribute)attr[0]).enumProperty)); &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; Now, we can simply decorate the flatten properties with this attribute: public class FlattenedRoom &#123; public int RoomNumber &#123; get; set; &#125; [FlattenedFlag(Facility.HasTV)] public bool HasTV &#123; get; set; &#125; [FlattenedFlag(Facility.HasMicrowave)] public bool HasMicrowave &#123; get; set; &#125; [FlattenedFlag(Facility.HasOven)] public bool HasOven &#123; get; set; &#125; public FlattenedRoom(int roomNumber, Facility facility) &#123; RoomNumber = roomNumber; FlattenedFlagAttribute.Flatten(this, facility); &#125; &#125; When you construct a new FlattenedRoom, simple feed it with the compacted Facility value, and everything will be correctly set.

Some basic concepts 1.1. What to scale? 1.2. Scaling directions 2. Geting scaled 2.1. Database scaling 2.1.1. Database Replication 2.1.2. Database sharding 2.1.3. Use a different type of database technology 2.2. Server Scaling 2.2.1. Cache 2.2.2. Stateless and multiple servers 2.2.3. Microservice Architecture 3. What about the client? 1. Some basic concepts 1.1. What to scale? A web service is a composite of multiple components. In the most straightforward system, they are: Database Server Client When we talk about scaling up the web service, we focus on database and server only. We can do nothing from the client side since we cannot force the client to use a specific device to access the web service. Depending on the nature of your system and&#x2F;or where the bottleneck is, you could choose which component to scale up to serve more requests. For example, if your system stores a vast amount of data and accesses them frequently, you may want to scale up the database. However, if your system is heavy on the calculation, then you may want to scale up the server. Of course, you can scale up both components. It is always the price&#x2F;performance problem. 1.2. Scaling directions There are 2 ways to scale a system: Scale-up: Adding more processing power (CPU, RAM, Storage) Scale-out: Adding more servers You cannot add an unlimited amount of CPU power, RAM, or storage. Adding more server to a system also add new problems like data consistency, choosing the server, concurrency access, etc. They are challenging, but fear not, there are solutions. 2. Geting scaled 2.1. Database scaling A database has 4 basic operations: CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DELETE. For each operation, there are specific ways to scale. 2.1.1. Database Replication For example, when you need to read a lot but write sometimes, you can use Database Replication, with one master database and multiple slaves. 2.1.2. Database sharding Sharding, or partitioning, is another approach to database scaling. You still use multiple databases, but different from replication, each database holds a portion of the data. A sharding strategy could be used to determine which data belong to which database. For example, you can store all records with odd id to a database and even id to another. However, this will introduce some new problems: What if all database is used up to their limit, and you need to add a new database? What if the data of a query is allocated to multiple databases? What if you need to remove a shard and copy its data to all other operational shards? There are other clever ways to scale the database, suitable for very specific systems. The key is to split and conquer. 2.1.3. Use a different type of database technology To SQL or NoSQL? Graph or table? Free or commercial? There are multiple databases technology out there. Based on the project’s business logic, the architect must choose the best database technology. For example, you can store all kinds of data in MongoDB and read them with extremely high performance and low cost. However, MongoDB doesn’t have join operation, Transaction, or Trigger. 2.2. Server Scaling The ultimate goal of scaling is to handle increasing traffic, or to reduce the response time of a single request. To do so, there are some solutions 2.2.1. Cache If the data will not change for a relatively long time, we can use cache to store that data. Whenever the data is needed, server read it directly from cache without calculation or take trip to database. 2.2.2. Stateless and multiple servers Stateless mean the server does not store the state of the request. Every requests are treated the same. This is important, because the servers don’t save state of the request, we can easily add more identical servers to increase the performance. However, to use multiple servers for a web service, we need a way to direct the request to the idle server. We call it the Load Balancer. Load Balancer How exactly load balancer balance the request between servers? By using some algorithm, the load balancer can evenly distribute the request. For example: The round robin algorithm. All server sit on a circle. The load balancer distribute one request to a server, then distribute the next request to the next server on the circle. 2.2.3. Microservice Architecture What if there is only one component get extremely high traffic? Is there anyway to scale components of the system separately? Microservice is an architecture that split the components of the server into smaller, stand-alone services. These services communicate with each other internally. When using Microservice architecture, developers can develop each services at different pace. For example, authentication service will not change much, but feature service will change over time. However, Microservice Architecture introduce some problems. If not used correctly, it could become a mess for the development. An excellent post about these problems: Disasters I’ve seen in a microservices world 3. What about the client? If we know for sure that our client is not some 1992 machine with limited CPU power and memory, then we can use the REST architecture. In short, the rendering (displaying text and image, animation, etc) jobs could be handled by the client. By this way, the server is only care about serving the data requested by the client. To increase the download speed of the client, we could use CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve static resources like JavaScript library, images, videos and audios, as well as CSS libraries. That’s it.

How StackOverflow works In the majority of developers use SO every day, many register to ask questions. Only a few answer these questions. For each response marked as “Answered,” a number of reputations were rewarded to the developer who provided the answers. They can also gain points if their answers were “Upvote” by other developers. 2. How do I get +10 reputation every day TL;DR: by luck. 2.1. The problem Not every day exactly. For example, one day I could get +50, while other days I didn’t get any. One day, while working on one of my projects, I type in commands to push my code to GitHub. Then boom, a wild error appear. The error looks like this: From https://github.com/MY/REPO * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD ! [rejected] latest -&gt; latest (would clobber existing tag) 9428765..935da94 master -&gt; origin/master A quick search show a StackOverflow question (Yessssss), but no answer yet. Luckily, StackOverflow is not the only place on the Internet answering dev’s questions, including discussion on open source projects, Git documentation. Half an hour later (okay 1 hour later), I finally know what happened and how can I fix it. 2.2. What’s happened? Someone on remote delete a tag, then recreate a new tag with the same name. Then when you try to Push or Pull, this error&#x2F;warning will happened on your local copy. 2.3. Fix and answer the StackOverflow’s question &lt;&lt;– here is my luck Then, a simple command line fix the problem for me. What’s next? I remembered there is an unanswered StackOverflow question on the exact same error. I add my solution, then left the website. https://stackoverflow.com/a/58438257/4506315 My luck with StackOverflow begins from that day. The next time I open SO for my next question, I saw +50 points added to my reputation. My solution was accepted as an answer. The next day, +10 reputation. Someone upvoted my answer, as they saw it helpful for their situation. On that time forward, I have an average of +10 reputation points every single day. This is my pure luck. Multiple conditions happened: I stumble upon a problem asked on StackOverflow that no one answered. The problem can be fixed by a simple solution. I provided the solution. Later, people have the same problem, and found my answer, and upvote my solution. 3.

StackOverflow Annual Developer Surveys 2. The State of Developer Ecosystem 3. Developer Economics survey 4. GitHub Octoverse 5. TIOBE Index 1. StackOverflow Annual Developer Surveys Link: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey By StackOverflow, this annual developer survey questioned thousands of developers who are using StackOverflow. The methodology is transparent. The results are open. The oldest survey was in 2011. More interestingly, they present the survey result of each year in an excellent report that you can view online. For example, below is the result of 2020. If a respondent spent less than 3 minutes in the survey, their responses are not included. One thing that I liked about this survey is that it split the result between all respondents and the professional developers. 2. The State of Developer Ecosystem Link: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/ By JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, PyCham, WebStorm, Rider, ReSharper, etc. Pretty much like the SO survey, this one provides data about the trending programming languages and operating systems. At the beginning of the result, a “Key Takeaways” section concludes the most important outcome. The survey also tells what languages developers plan to adopt&#x2F;migrate. The oldest dataset was in 2017. 3. Developer Economics survey Link: https://www.developereconomics.com/resources/graphs You will need to register for an account to view the result This survey is the only survey on the list that requires an account to see the result. Good thing that there are two reports each year, in Q1 and Q3. The participants were also rewarded with points that can be used to cash out with vouchers and draw. This survey’s most helpful information is the most popular programming languages in technology like Web, Data Science, Machine Learning, Desktop Application, etc. The oldest dataset was in 2010 4. GitHub Octoverse Link: https://octoverse.github.com/ This one is not precisely a survey but an analysis of GitHub data on open-source projects. The result is more focused on the communities and social aspects of developers in open-source. This analysis is new. Only data for 2020 is available. 5. TIOBE Index Link: tiobe index TIOBE index is a number (in percent) count for +&quot;&lt;language&gt; programming&quot; on search engines. The number of hits determines the ratings of a language. The counted hits are normalized for each search engine for all languages in the list. In other words, all languages together have a score of 100%. The dataset is not free.

Exact match 2.2. Skip some tags 2.3. Match all tags start with a character 3. Match multiple grammars 4. Full list of tags 1. Part-of-Speech tagging This action simply tag your tokenized words with the word type, for example, verb, noun, adjective, etc. 1.1. The tags and explanations The complete list of tags can be shown when running the command nltk.help.upenn_tagset() For the complete list of explanations, scroll to the bottom of this post. 1.2. Tagging them For example, when you have the sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog The process should be something like this sentence = &#x27;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&#x27; tokens = nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(sentence) tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens) # result of &#x27;tags&#x27; # [(&#x27;The&#x27;, &#x27;DT&#x27;), (&#x27;quick&#x27;, &#x27;JJ&#x27;), (&#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;), (&#x27;fox&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;), (&#x27;jumps&#x27;, &#x27;VBZ&#x27;), (&#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;IN&#x27;), (&#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;DT&#x27;), (&#x27;lazy&#x27;, &#x27;JJ&#x27;), (&#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;)] 2. Regular Expression (regex) grammar The regular expression with nltk tokens is quite different from standard text. The grammar treats each token as a string of text and applies the regex pattern on that string matched to the position of the token in the sentence. Below I will present a list of grammar, from the most simple to the more complex one, using the same sentence above 2.1. Exact match sentence = &#x27;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&#x27; tokens = nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(sentence) tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens) # result of &#x27;tags&#x27; # [(&#x27;The&#x27;, &#x27;DT&#x27;), (&#x27;quick&#x27;, &#x27;JJ&#x27;), (&#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;), (&#x27;fox&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;), (&#x27;jumps&#x27;, &#x27;VBZ&#x27;), (&#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;IN&#x27;), (&#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;DT&#x27;), (&#x27;lazy&#x27;, &#x27;JJ&#x27;), (&#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;)] grammar = &#x27;exact: &#123;&lt;DT&gt;&lt;JJ&gt;&lt;NN&gt;&lt;NN&gt;&#125;&#x27; parser = nltk.RegexpParser(grammar) result = parser.parse(tags) # parsed result # Tree # (&#x27;S&#x27;, [Tree(&#x27;exact&#x27;, [(&#x27;The&#x27;, &#x27;DT&#x27;), (&#x27;quick&#x27;, &#x27;JJ&#x27;), (&#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;), (&#x27;fox&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;)]), # (&#x27;jumps&#x27;, &#x27;VBZ&#x27;), # (&#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;IN&#x27;), # (&#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;DT&#x27;), # (&#x27;lazy&#x27;, &#x27;JJ&#x27;), # (&#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27;NN&#x27;)]) 2.2.

Microsoft introduces its codespaces first in Visual Studio Online, using your Azure account to charge. “GitHub codespaces” is in the early access stage, so everything is free for now. To request early access to GitHub codespaces, here is the link: https://github.com/features/codespaces 2. Using GitHub codespaces When you’re invited to use codespaces, your GitHub’s repositories will have another option in open button 2.1. Change theme The default theme for VSCode is light. Light attracting bugs. So we need to change it to dark The typical themes used by vscode is not working, so we need to use an extension developed by GitHub called github theme Sadly, the icon theme is fixed with 1 of the two default set. 2.2. Settings Except for some settings related to themes and icons that have no effect, almost all other settings are the same. You can just copy and paste the settings from your local vscode to codespaces vscode 2.3. Install your programming language extensions I think every programming language extension worked as it should be, but first, you will need to set up the development environment in Linux. For example, to use Java, you will need to install JDK on Linux, then Java Extension Pack for a complete list of Java extensions in vscode. C&#x2F;C++ and Python extensions are pre-installed When you open a project, based on the language, some language extension will be pre-installed 2.4. Work with multiple repository By default, one codespace can only work with one repository. I will use the SSH key to have access to every repository on my Github. Generate SSH key $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot; Add ssh key to ssh agent $ eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot; &gt; Agent pid xxxxx $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa Add the public key to GitHub Add the key to settings at SSH settings Change repo remote URL from HTTPS to SSH git remote set-url origin git@github.com:&lt;Username&gt;/&lt;Project&gt;.git That’s it 3. Some interesting things I found The codespaces running on Debian 9.13 - lsb_release -a 4GB of RAM - free -m Using 2 core of the Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8168 CPU @ 2.70GHz - less /proc/cpuinfo and cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l The vscode version is the latest Insider version, so expect some errors and unstable features","categories":[{"name":"Computer Tips","slug":"Computer-Tips","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Computer-Tips/"},{"name":"Others","slug":"Others","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Others/"}],"tags":[{"name":"github","slug":"github","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/github/"},{"name":"vscode","slug":"vscode","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/vscode/"}]},{"title":"Migrate Azure DevOps TFS to Git reserving history","slug":"migrate-azure-devops-tfs-to-git-reserving-history","date":"2020-07-30T04:31:02.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/07/30/migrate-azure-devops-tfs-to-git-reserving-history/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2020/07/30/migrate-azure-devops-tfs-to-git-reserving-history/","excerpt":"Microsoft acquired GitHub, and everyone has an unlimited number of private repositories.

Push code 1. A bit of historyIn around 2012, developers don’t have many choices in where to store their code for free. Sure, you can use GitHub, but it limits the number of private repositories and the number of collaborators. The obvious choice at that time was Visual Studio Online, or today Azure DevOps. The only source control system it is provided is Team Foundation Server (TFS). Today, 9.99 over 10 developers will choose git over tfs, and we need a way to migrate from TFS, with history, to git. 2. Required tools git git-tfs Alternatively, you can install git-tf with Chocolatey: choco install gittfs 3. Migration steps3.1. Clone the TFS projectgit-tfs clone https://your\\_organization.visualstudio.com/ $/your\\_project\\_name If your project name contains whitespace, just put the whole name in the quote mark git-tfs clone https://your\\_organization.visualstudio.com/ &quot;$/your project name&quot; This command will clone the project to the folder you run the command 3.2. Add .gitignoreNow the project is like any other git project, with a .git folder. You should add a .gitignore file to prevent commit unwanted files. A sample .gitinore file here: Visual Studio Git Ignore 3.3. Push codeThe final step is to push code to your favorite git service.","categories":[{"name":"Computer Tips","slug":"Computer-Tips","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Computer-Tips/"},{"name":"Others","slug":"Others","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Others/"}],"tags":[{"name":"git","slug":"git","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/git/"},{"name":"TFS","slug":"TFS","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/TFS/"},{"name":"devops","slug":"devops","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/devops/"}]},{"title":"Connect with Google Cloud Compute Engine (Virtual Machine) using PuTTY","slug":"connect-with-google-cloud-compute-engine-virtual-machine-using-putty","date":"2020-07-20T22:28:46.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/07/20/connect-with-google-cloud-compute-engine-virtual-machine-using-putty/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/connect-with-google-cloud-compute-engine-virtual-machine-using-putty/","excerpt":"I don’t know why Google makes it so challenging to connect to its Compute Engine cloud service.

Why don’t they just call it Virtual Machine? Anyway, here is how to connect. 1. Have your Compute Engine ready 2. Have your local machine ready 3. Add key to virtual machine 4. Connect with WinSCP 1. Have your Compute Engine readyAfter creating a VM instance, note the External IP. Click on the little three-dot icon at the end of the VM and choose View network details On the new open site, choose Firewall and make sure tcp:22 is allowed (so we can use ssh to connect) 2. Have your local machine readyYou will need to generate a public-private key pair on your local machine. In this tutorial, I use puttygen installed alongside with putty Click generate and move your mouse in the blank area until a key appeared Enter a password for the generated key, change the Key comment to something easy to remember (this will be your username later), click Save private key to a .ppk file. Copy the key shown in the box. 3. Add key to the virtual machineClick the ssh button on your VM instance to open the online ssh window Call the following commands: Create .ssh folder sudo mkdir -p ~&#x2F;.ssh Write the key to the authorized_keys file sudo echo your_copied_key_here &gt;&gt; ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;authorized_keys Set permission for the file and folder sudo chmod -R go&#x3D; ~&#x2F;.ssh 4. Connect with WinSCPWait, the title said Putty isn’t it? Hang on; we are getting there. WinSCP is a popular SFTP client and FTP client for Microsoft Windows, as they said. It’s open-source and can be installed via MS Store or Chocolatey Filled in the information you have. The username IS the key comment you set above. Then click on Advanced... Choose Environment &gt; SFTP, then paste this line to the box SFTP Server to allow root permission on all files and folders This works with Ubuntu only. Other distribution may have a different location of sftp-server sudo su -c &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;openssh&#x2F;sftp-server Choose SSH &gt; Authentication and browse to the private key you saved before. Click OK to go back to the login screen When logging in, you will be asked for the password. This is the password you’ve set for your private key before. After connecting, click Commands &gt; Open in PuTTY, and voilà, the ssh window appeared and connected, asking for the same password. I don’t know why, but connect directly with PuTTY or SuperPuTTY DOES NOT WORK.","categories":[{"name":"Others","slug":"Others","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Others/"}],"tags":[{"name":"virtual machine","slug":"virtual-machine","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/virtual-machine/"},{"name":"compute engine","slug":"compute-engine","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/compute-engine/"},{"name":"google cloud","slug":"google-cloud","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/google-cloud/"},{"name":"putty","slug":"putty","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/putty/"}]},{"title":"[java] Refactoring Clones type 2","slug":"refactoring-clones-type-2","date":"2019-10-19T20:10:18.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/10/19/refactoring-clones-type-2/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/10/19/refactoring-clones-type-2/","excerpt":"Removing clones in code maybe is the most challenging type of refactoring action.

In this post, I will show you how to refactor a clone type 2 using Functional Interface in Java and delegate in C# Type of clonesThere are 4 types of clones: Type 1: The codes cloned are identical, except the name of variables, add or remove of comment. Type 2: code fragments are structurally and syntactically identical except for variations in identifiers, literals, types, in addition to Type I differences. Type 3: code fragments are copies with further modifications. Statements can be changed, added, or removed in addition to Type II differences. Type 4: two or more code fragments perform the exact computation but are implemented through different syntactic variants. S. Bellon, R. Koschke, G. Antoniol, J. Krinke and E. Merlo, Comparison and Evaluation of Clone DetectionTools, Transactions on Software Engineering, 33(9):577-591 (2007) Removing clonesType 1: just remove the second fragment of code and use the first one Type 3: Based on the function of the code fragment (usually clone codes are in methods), you can perform other refactors like break the method into smaller ones (extract method), then consider if you can transform type 3 clone into type 2. Type 4: This one is the most difficult to detect. To eliminate it is easy, just use one of them. I believe to detect this kind of clone, you can inspect the before and after the condition of the questioned methods. If they are the same (use the same set of parameters, return the same result, verified by unit tests), then the function of these methods is identical. For type 2 clone, we will try to transform it to type 1, then introduce the parameter in a new common method by using a language-specific feature called FunctionalInterface in Java and delegate in C# ExamplesConsider these lines of code: public void drawVerticalLine(int length, View currentView)&#123; DrawOptions drawOptions = currentView.getVerticalOptions(); currentView.draw(length, drawOptions); &#125; public void drawHorizontalLine(int length, View currentView)&#123; DrawOptions drawOptions = currentView.getHorizontalOptions(); currentView.draw(length, drawOptions); &#125; In the 2 methods above, both draw a line to screen; the difference is the drawOptions variable. To introduce parameters to “transform” this type of clone to type 1, we can do as follow: &#x2F;* For JAVA *&#x2F; public void drawVerticalLine(int length, View currentView)&#123; drawLine(length, currentView, () -&gt; currentView.getVerticalOption()); &#125; public void drawHorizontalLine(int length, View currentView)&#123; drawLine(length, currentView, () -&gt; currentView.getHorizontalOption()); &#125; @FunctionalInterface private interface DrawOption &#123; int getDrawOption(); &#125; public void drawLine(int length, View currentView, DrawOption drawOption)&#123; int options = drawOption.getDrawOption(); currentView.draw(length, options) &#125; and for C# public void drawVerticalLine(int length, View currentView)&#123; drawLine(length, currentView, () =&gt; currentView.getVerticalOption()); &#125; public void drawHorizontalLine(int length, View currentView)&#123; drawLine(length, currentView, () =&gt; currentView.getHorizontalOption()); &#125; public void drawLine(int length, View currentView, Func&lt;int&gt; drawOption)&#123; int option = drawOption(); currentView.draw(length, option); &#125; Using a toolIf you are using Eclipse, JDeodorant plug-in by Associate Professor Nikos Tsantalis can automatically extract the clone into common method for you.

Sure you can share the .vue file, but how can you publish it to npmjs, for the ease of installation and usage of others? With the release of Vue CLI 3, build target -lib is supported, but no tutorials available “out there”, so here is one (and hopfully not the last). 1. Requirements 2. Steps 2.1. Setup your project 2.2. Add config for vue.js 2.3. Edit package.json 3. Build, Test and Publish 3.1. Build 3.2. Test 3.3. Publish 4. Test the published package 1. Requirements Of course you will need an npmjs account. Go register one. vue-cli 3 (as the time this tutorial was written), install it globally using npm install -g @vue&#x2F;cli vue cli-service-global add-on for quick project prototype, install it globally using npm install -g @vue&#x2F;cli-service-global Your component source code A text editor of your choice (VSCode is my personal suggestion) 2. Steps 2.1. Setup your project For instruction purpose, just a simple hello world project will do. Create a new folder, let call it my_component Open that folder using vscode, press Ctrl + Shift + ` to open a new terminal inside root folder Create your project, and choose your preferred options. vue create . if you want to create a new project including root folder, type vue create your-folder-name your project structure should basically look like this if you choose all default type npm run serve will build the project and serve it using a local server 2.2. Add config for vue.js Add a new file to root folder with the name vue.config.js. In this file, you will be able to setup the build to include all your components *.css in a separated file or inside the component .js file. Each option have it pro and cons. For simplicity, I choose to include inside the .js file. module.exports &#x3D; { css: { extract: false }} 2.3. Edit package.json Add build commandOpen package.json and add the following line under scripts section “build:helloworld”: “vue-cli-service build –target lib –name my_component .&#x2F;src&#x2F;components&#x2F;HelloWorld.vue”, It will look like this Pointing to output Add the target for npm to package.json “main”: “.&#x2F;dist&#x2F;my_component.udm.js”, Add file attribute This settings indicate which file types should be uploaded to npmjs “files”: [ “dist&#x2F;*.js” “dist&#x2F;*.css”], Other information for npmjs “description”: “A hello world vuejs components”,“author”: “Hunter Tran”,“license”: “MIT”, If your component use other components or packages, you need to specify them in dependencies, here is more info on npmjs.com 3. Build, Test and Publish 3.1. Build Build your project using the new command npm run build:helloworld 3.2. Test The build command above will create a dist folder, including a demo.html site. Open that file using a browser to test your newly created component. You may need to modify that file a bit if your components is not ready to use and require some setup (like require data to run) 3.3. Publish Simple enough, just type npm publish and follow the instruction. 4. Test the published package Finally, you can try your newly published package in a new “Hello World” vue cli project, or use the built yourpackagename.common.js file directly in your &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section.","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"},{"name":"JavaScript and TypeScript","slug":"JavaScript-and-TypeScript","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/JavaScript-and-TypeScript/"},{"name":"VSCode","slug":"VSCode","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/VSCode/"}],"tags":[{"name":"component","slug":"component","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/component/"},{"name":"vue","slug":"vue","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/vue/"},{"name":"vue-cli","slug":"vue-cli","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/vue-cli/"},{"name":"vuejs","slug":"vuejs","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/vuejs/"}]},{"title":"Java for Beginner - 3 - Java from C# cheats sheet","slug":"java-for-beginner-3-java-from-c-cheats-sheet","date":"2019-07-14T01:15:56.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/07/14/java-for-beginner-3-java-from-c-cheats-sheet/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/07/14/java-for-beginner-3-java-from-c-cheats-sheet/","excerpt":"Doing C# long enough, you get yourself familiar with C# concepts and syntax.

Variables 3. Methods 3.1. Extension Method 3.2. Safely use resource 3.3. Class Properties 1. Classes1.1. Some keywordsC# Java Explanation for Java : (to extend the class) extends Java use the keyword extends to extend a class base super To access the base class methods namespace package Java class belongs to a package, which is the name of the folder contains the .java file internal Java use the concept of package. More complicated convertion is here using import Java Example &#x2F;&#x2F; File Animal.java, inside folder animalspackage main.java.animals; import RandomPackage.*;import RandomPackage.RandomSubPackage.*; public class Animal { … other methods and properties … public Double getWeight() { return weight; } … other methods and properties …} &#x2F;&#x2F; File Pig.java, inside folder animalspackage main.java.animals; public class Pig extends Animal { … other methods and properties … // override the getWeight method public Double getWeight() &#123; // do your override stuffs return super.getWeight(); &#125; ... other methods and properties ... } 1.2. Generic ClassGeneric class with constraint C# Example public class GenericClass where T: SomeBase{} Java Example public class GenericClass{} 1.3. Interface ImplementJava Example public class Pig implements IAnimal { public void Run() { …your code to make the pig run… }} 2. VariablesC# Java Explanation for Java string java.lang.String string in both is a immutable class (cannot change instance of object after create) object java.lang.Object decimal java.math.BigDecimal Java Example String hello &#x3D; “Hello World!”;System.out.print(hello); 3. Methods3.1. Extension MethodIn C#, you can write extension to an object, there is no equivalent to this in Java. C# public static class StringExtension{ public static string GetFirstThreeLetters(this string targetString) { &#x2F;&#x2F; your code here to do the job &#x2F;&#x2F; for example: &#x2F;&#x2F; string result &#x3D; targetString.SubString(0,3); return result; }} public class TestClass{ public void TestMethod() { string randomString &#x3D; “This is so random”; Console.WriteLine(randomString.GetFirstThreeLetters); }} &#x2F;&#x2F; Console Output&#x2F;&#x2F; Thi But in Java, you need to have the full static class public final class StringUtils { public static String GetFirstThreeLetters(String stringToGet) { &#x2F;&#x2F; your code here to do the job &#x2F;&#x2F; for example: &#x2F;&#x2F; String result &#x3D; stringToGet.substring(0,3); return result; }} public class TestClass{ private void TestMethod() { String randomString &#x3D; “This is so random”; StringUtils.GetFirstThreeLetters(randomString); }} &#x2F;&#x2F; Console Output&#x2F;&#x2F; Thi 3.2. Safely use resourceIn C#, you can use a resource safely with the keyword using C# Example using(MyResource myResource &#x3D; new MyResource()){ myResource.DoSomething();} In Java, you will use a different keyword: try Java Example try(MyResource myResource &#x3D; new MyResource()) { myResource.DoSomething();} 3.3. Class PropertiesIt is very convenient for C# developers to create and use property with auto-property, property with private backing fields. C# Example public class Animal{ &#x2F;&#x2F; Auto-property public int Height { get; set; } // Property with private backing field // &#123;rivate field private int \\_weight; // Exposed with public property public int Weight &#123; get &#123; return \\_weight; &#125; set &#123; // do some check to validate the value if(value &gt; 0) &#123; \\_weight = value; &#125; &#125; &#125; } &#x2F;&#x2F; using in other classpublic void RandomMethod(){ Animal pig &#x3D; new Animal(); pig.Weight &#x3D; 500; Console.WriteLine(&quot;Pig weight: &quot; + pig.Weight); } There is no equivalent to this in Java, you need to create 2 normal methods for get and set value of a private field Java Example public class Animal { private int _weight; public void setWeight(int weight) &#123; if(weight &gt; 0) &#123; \\_weight = weight; &#125; &#125; public int getWeight() &#123; return \\_weight; &#125; } &#x2F;&#x2F; using in other classpublic void RandomMethod() { Animal pig &#x3D; new Animal(); pig.setWeight(500); System.out.print(&quot;Pig weight: &quot; + pig.getWeight()); } Other different is just one google search result away ;) See you next post","categories":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Java/"}],"tags":[{"name":"java for beginner","slug":"java-for-beginner","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/java-for-beginner/"},{"name":"cheats sheet","slug":"cheats-sheet","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/cheats-sheet/"}]},{"title":"Java for Beginner - 2 - Hello World in Java","slug":"java-for-beginner-2-hello-world-in-java","date":"2019-07-12T16:40:13.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/07/12/java-for-beginner-2-hello-world-in-java/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/07/12/java-for-beginner-2-hello-world-in-java/","excerpt":"After getting yourself familiar with names and terms in Java in part 1, now it’s time for you to create your first program in Java.","text":"After getting yourself familiar with names and terms in Java in part 1, now it’s time for you to create your first program in Java. 1.

SetupFor a beginner, tools and supports from those tools is quite vital. Someone will said that you should learn new language by using a basic text editor like Notepad. In my opinion, don’t do it. Use a IDE, or at least VSCode with supporting extensions, and re-type any code that you read, don’t copy and paste them. 1.1. Required Tools Visual Studio Code - Cross platform, fast and beautiful (especially dark theme is an ease for your eye). Java Extension Pack (GitHub) - install - a set of extensions for VSCode to work with Java Prebuilt OpenJDK by Adopt OpenJDK (free) - including JVM. This project is community backed with short and easy explanation, perfect for beginner. Some other tools that will be install on-the-fly 1.2. Set environment variablesSet JAVA_HOME to the folder you have install JDK Start &gt; type advanced system settings &gt; Environment Variables… Then add a new System Variable JAVA_HOME C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_161 2. Start coding2.1. Hello World in JavaUnlike .NET, JAVA required a specific folder structure. Each .java file should contain only 1 class, and that class must declare package with the name of the folder. Open VSCode and create the following folder structure &lt;your_project_name&gt; |-src | |-main | | |-java | | | |-hello Inside hello folder, create Application.java, then type the following code package main.hello; public class Application &#123; public static void main(String args) &#123; String hello = &quot;Hello World!&quot;; System.out.print(hello); &#125; &#125; 2.2. Run and DebugCreate configuration file (VSCode will automatically do this) .vscode folder added to folder structure, with launch.json file created, the content should look like this &#123; // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes. // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes. // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387 &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;, &quot;configurations&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;type&quot;: &quot;java&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Debug (Launch) - Current File&quot;, &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;, &quot;mainClass&quot;: &quot;$&#123;file&#125;&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;type&quot;: &quot;java&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Debug (Launch)-Application&quot;, &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;, &quot;mainClass&quot;: &quot;main.hello.Application&quot; &#125; ] &#125; Press F5 (or that green arrow button), and the word Hello World! will be printed on debug console To debug, put a break point in line 7 Then press F5 again 3. Java Build ToolsTo build a java file, you need a build tool. In the tutorial above, VSCode has already done that for you. The most widely used build tool for Java right now is Gradle and Maven.

Intro 1.1. What it can do 1.2. Write one, run anywhere 2. Versions and Tools 2.1. Versions 2.2. Tools 2.3. Terms 3. Frameworks 1. Intro1.1. What it can doWhen a person decided to study some new programming language or platform, the first question could be the purpose. Why do you want to study this language&#x2F;platform? What it can do compared to xyz language? The answer: almost anything! From mobile application to huge software used in banking, super-computer and satellite in the sky. 1.2. Write one, run anywhereIdeally, a Java developer can write the code one, and run it anywhere that can run Java Virtual Machine (JVM). But we live in an un-ideal world. There are differences between devices and operating systems, so there are different versions of JVM implementation. The famous title became Write one, debug everywhere 2. Versions and Tools2.1. VersionsJava have different versions for different purpose Java ME: Java Micro Edition. Optimized for mobile, embedded devices (like outdoor billboard, TV boxes, printers, etc.). The SDK for Java ME haven’t had update since Jan 2018 (as of July 2019) Java SE: Java Standard Edition. The name says it all. You can develop desktops and servers applications using this version. The latest version is 12.0.1 (as of July 2019) Java EE: Java Enterprise Edition. Support a lot more APIs like JSON processing, annotations, contexts and dependency injections. The latest version is 8u1 (I know, the version number is strange) Java Embedded, Java TV, Java Card: Seem like different version of Java ME with a much more updated SDK. More info here 2.2. ToolsCome along with Java are a lot of tools IDE: Eclipse, Netbeans, VSCode with extensions (free), Jetbrains’s IntelliJ IDEA Servers (only for Java EE): Wildfly open source by Redhat, GlassFish open source (part of eclipse-ee4j), Apache Tomcat open source. 2.3. Terms JRE: Java Runtime Environment JDK: Java Development Kits. JDK has multiple implementation because of a long and complicated relationships between big firms JFX: or JavaFX. Things get strange from here. “OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems built on Java” they said. But to be honest, I don’t understand what is the difference between the “normal” java and the “next generation” java, since both are in active development. 3. FrameworksIn Microsoft world, .NET is the framework. If you want full-feature, compatible with old system, use .NET Framework (latest 4.8). If you want cross-platform (yes, including Linux), use .NET Core. And if you wait long enough, you can use .NET 5, as they said “There will be just one .NET going forward, and you will be able to use it to target Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, tvOS, watchOS and WebAssembly and more.” Things are different in Java world. Java first created by Sun Microsystem, then bought by Oracle (then oracle sue Google for using some lines of code in Android). A lot of community driven frameworks has been developed for Java. There is no “one framework to fit all” like .NET. This bend the learning curve, make it difficult for a developer to jump from one framework to another. For a beginner, the curve even worst. A lot of names and terms to familiar, and then you must choose a framework to “dive in”. Reader beware, silly names are coming. Apache Struts: MVC pattern, open source. Spring Boot: MVC pattern, reliable, big community Grails: Built on top of Sprint Boot easy to learn, use, has excellent document with a lot of plugin The problems are, each of these frameworks implement a slightly different conventions and introduce different concepts. Too much for “write one, run anywhere” ei? Another problem: you will never know if a framework is about to abandon, so stick to a single framework seem risky (for me at least, since in .net, I know that specific version of .net framework will continue to be supported and easily upgraded to newer version with minimum effort) That’s all for introduction of Java.

Curios, I click on page 1 of the search result, and voila, some sites with tricky SEO technique take the few first result. The point is, they are copying content from my blog, without my authorization. It’s time to tackle this problem. 1. Search for all other sites 2. Is the site tolerable? 3. File a DMCA report 4. What happened after a link is approved 1. Search for all other sitesI thought this would be easy. Turn out it the most difficult step to take. The violated sites are managed by ‘master’ of Search Engine Optimization. They know how to optimize their site for better place in Google search result. They also know how to change your post just a little bit to deceive the Google algorithm to find duplication. Search for the title. This search is easy. Copy your post title (maybe you have to remove all the special character like [] or &#123;&#125;). Sometime, when your title is written in English, you can translate it to your mother tongue language. Search for a sentence. Choose short sentence with your writing style that cannot be meet elsewhere is the best option. A short sentence for this search to work would have more than 10 or 15 words. Search by Image. This is the last search that I have made. The result is not useful but try anyway. 2. Is the site tolerable?In Vietnam, it’s a tacit agreement when you copy the whole post published by someone else, then re-post it on your site and have a link back to the original content (at the end or beginning of the post). I know this is not legal in many countries. Instead, you are only allowed to “quote” a segment, a sentence from that original post with appropriate citing. That’s why your next job is to determine that the violated site worthy to use your hard work and research, time and money for free. I suggest no. 3. File a DMCA reportThis will be the easiest step. You will need your Google account, and Link to your original content. Link to violated content (must be a link to specific post) Time Go to Google Legal page and select accordingly The result should look like this 4. What happened after a link is approvedThe certain outcome is that the link will be removed from Google search result (including all other search tool using Google search engine). Another possible outcome is that the violated site (with enough DMCA report), will be remove completely from google search result.

Cost Function for Logistic Regression 1.1. Công thức 1.2. Đồ thị 1.3. Kết luận 2. Đơn giản hóa Cost Function và áp dụng Gradient Descent 2.1. Biến đổi 2.2. Gradient Descent 3. Advanced Optimization 1. Cost Function for Logistic RegressionĐối với linear regression, ta có thể dùng cost function như sau $latex \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$ Tuy nhiên, nếu áp dụng cùng công thức này với Logistic Regression, ta sẽ có 1 đồ thị vô cùng “gập ghềnh”, với rất nhiều điểm local optimal. Điều này trở thành một trở ngại vô cùng lớn với thuật toán gradient descent. 1.1. Công thứcNói cách khác, nó sẽ không phải là một “convex function” Thay vào đó, cost function cho Logistic Regression sẽ giống như sau $latex J(\\theta) &#x3D; \\dfrac{1}{m} \\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)})$$latex \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) &#x3D; -\\log(h_\\theta(x)) \\quad \\quad \\quad \\text{if y &#x3D; 1}$$latex \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) &#x3D; -\\log(1-h_\\theta(x)) \\quad \\quad \\text{if y &#x3D; 0}$ 1.2. Đồ thịKhi y &#x3D; 1, ta có đồ thị sau cho $J(\\theta)$ và $h_\\theta(x)$: Tương tự, ta có đồ thị sau khi y &#x3D; 0, ta có đồ thị sau Kết luậnDựa vào đồ thị, ta có thể rút ra kết luận sau $latex \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) &#x3D; 0 \\text{ if } h_\\theta(x) &#x3D; y$$latex \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y &#x3D; 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 1$$latex \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y &#x3D; 1 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 0$ Như vậy, khi cost &#x3D; 0, thì hàm hypothesis &#x3D; y (cho cả trường hợp y &#x3D; 0 hoặc y &#x3D; 1) Ngược lại nếu y &#x3D; 0, và hypothesis tiến dần tới 1, thì cost sẽ tiến dần tới vô cực nếu y &#x3D; 1, và hypothesis tiến dần tới 0, thì cost sẽ tiến dần tới vô cực 2. Đơn giản hóa Cost Function và áp dụng Gradient Descent2.1. Biến đổiVới biểu thức ở trên, chỉ cần biến đổi một chút, ta có thể thu gọn nó vào thành 1 biểu thức như sau: $latex \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) &#x3D; - y \\; \\log(h_\\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \\log(1 - h_\\theta(x))$ y chỉ có 2 giá trị hoặc &#x3D; 1 hoặc &#x3D; 0. Lần lượt thay 2 giá trị này vào biểu thức trên, ta sẽ thấy 1 trong 2 biểu thức con bị triệt tiêu. Với data của bộ training sets, ta có thể viết đầy đủ biểu thức của cost function như sau: $latex J(\\theta) &#x3D; -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{m}[y^{(i)}log(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})log(1-h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))]$ Sau đó, ta có thể “vector hóa” biểu thức này $latex h &#x3D; g(X\\theta) \\ J(\\theta) &#x3D; \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\left(-y^{T}\\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\\log(1-h)\\right)$ 2.2. Gradient DescentNhắc lại một chút, dạng tổng quát của Gradient Descent như sao: $latex Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\ \\; \\theta_j :&#x3D; \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta) \\ \\rbrace$ Dùng đạo hàm, ta có thể tính được: $latex Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\ \\; \\theta_j :&#x3D; \\theta_j - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} \\ \\rbrace$ áp bộ giá trị của training set vào, và chuyển thành toán tuyến tính (vectorise), ta có phép tính sau $latex \\theta:&#x3D;\\theta-\\frac{\\alpha}{m}X^T(g(X\\theta)-\\vec{y})$ 3. Advanced OptimizationBên cạnh thuật toán Gradient Descent dùng để tính toán giá trị tối ưu của $latex \\theta$, chúng ta còn có nhiều thuật toán phức tạp hơn, nhưng cũng nhanh hơn nhiều: Conjugate gradient BFGS l-BFGS Các thuật toán này đều đã được xây dựng và tối ưu hóa trong các thư viện số học của nhiều ngôn ngữ lập trình. Đầu tiên, chúng ta sẽ cần công thức để tính toán 2 biểu thức $latex J(\\theta) \\ \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta)$ Tùy thuộc vào ngôn ngữ lập trình sẽ có các cú pháp khác nhau. Đối với Matlab, ta có thể viết 1 function duy nhất trả về cả 2 giá trị trên: function [jVal, gradient] &#x3D; costFunction(theta) jVal &#x3D; […code to compute J(theta)…]; gradient &#x3D; […code to compute derivative of J(theta)…];end Sau đó, ta dùng function optimset() để tạo ra 1 object chứa các option cân thiết. Dùng object này đưa vào function fminunc() của Octave. Kết quả tính toán sẽ là 1 vector chứa các giá trị tối ưu của $latex \\theta$ options &#x3D; optimset(‘GradObj’, ‘on’, ‘MaxIter’, 100);initialTheta &#x3D; zeros(2,1); [optTheta, functionVal, exitFlag] &#x3D; fminunc(@costFunction, initialTheta, options);","categories":[{"name":"Others","slug":"Others","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Others/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"[Research] - Gecko Dom Logging system","slug":"gecko-dom-logging-system","date":"2019-06-14T04:12:17.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/06/14/gecko-dom-logging-system/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/06/14/gecko-dom-logging-system/","excerpt":"The purpose of this documentation is to record all the findings and my progress while exploring Firefox source code, in order to log how many time a DOM API is called when visit a single website, or multiple common website.

Setup and InitializationIn short, to get the latest version of Firefox source code, one could follow the official instruction on Building Firefox for Windows One small modification in which will decrease the time needed to build the source code: You will not need the “Game development with C++” while installing&#x2F;modifying Visual Studio 2019 2. Source code structureMozilla use Gecko to render web content. More than that, Gecko is also used to render the firefox user interface. On Windows, Gecko use Microsoft COM, on other platforms, Gecko use XPCOM to render user interface. The whole source code is mentioned as Gecko, and mirrored in Mozilla’s Github Repository 2.1. Built-in extensionsFirefox contains 2 built-in extension: PDF.js and Shumway. PDF.js: To open and read PDF files inside firefox, without opening another software Shumway: provide a way to render swf (Shock Wave Flash) file, which is quite popular in older websites to display animations, game, effects. These files has been replaced with HTML5, and considered as a security vulnerable in modern websites. 2.2. JavaScript Engine (SpiderMonkey)Located in js\\src, the Firefox’s JavaScript Engine is called SpiderMonkey, and is in active development at mozilla-central&#x2F;file&#x2F;tip&#x2F;js&#x2F;src Beside the interpreter, SpiderMonkey contains a compiler , a garbage collector and a Just-in-time compiler. 3. Understanding DOMDOM stands for Document Object Model. To understand what DOM is, first we need to understand the basic of a website Websites are a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML is a structured documents, and can be mapped by using a tree structure, starting with html tag as root. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document’s structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed. Document Object Model - Mozilla Developer Docs 3.1. DOM LevelsDocument Object Model API is implemented in level. The lower the level, the more basic and simple functions it defined. Currently there are 3 levels, which are mostly implemented by all modern browsers (Partly implemented for Level 3) 3.1.1. DOM Level 1Provide interface to represent any structured document, as well as accessing and manipulating nodes. In level 1, DOM also define extended interfaces that counted as part of the specification, but not necessary for a HTML-only implementation of DOM specification. The getElementsByTagName method is defined in level DOM 1 specification. 3.1.2. DOM Level 2Provide 6 separated specifications: Core: Extend the functionalities of Level 1. Views: Allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content of a representation of a document. Events: Define basic of event system, including the concept of event flow, listening, bubbling, cancellation. Styles: Access and update stylesheet. Traversal and Range: Allow programs and scripts to dynamically walk-through and identify a range of contents in a document, as well as creation, insertion, modification and deletion of a range of contents. HTML: Extend the interfaces defined in Level 1, using the Core level 2 possibilities. Most of the famous JavaScripts functions are defined in level 2 getElementById in Core addEventListener and handleEvent in Events getComputedStyle in Styles NodeIterator and TreeWalker in Traversal and Range contentDocument property in HTML 3.1.3. DOM Level 3Unlike level 1 and 2, only a few methods and properties in DOM level 3 are supported. Level 3 provide advanced functionalities to manipulate DOM and XML. Firefox divide DOM Level 3 in 5 separated part, with different level of support Core: Only a few methods and properties are supported. Load and Save: dynamically load XML documents into DOM or serialize DOM to XML docs. None supported Validation: Update content and ensure validity. Firefox not support this interface Events: Keyboard events and how to handle them. Partly supported. XPath: Simple functionalities to access DOM tree using XPath. 3.2. Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM3.2.1. Shadow DOMShadow DOM is an complete dom tree hidden inside an dom node. All the markups, structures, styles or behaviors are separated from actual&#x2F;normal dom. The reason for this concept is to develop low level web components that will have default user interface&#x2F;behaviors across websites (e.g &lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt; tag with default control buttons provided by browsers) 3.2.2. Virtual DOMIn short, Virtual DOM is an abstraction of DOM. It represent for a small subset of DOM, and update the actual DOM accordingly. Virtual DOM is implemented not by browsers, but by high level javascript libraries (eg React, asm-dom, etc) Virtual DOM libraries compare changed nodes with actual node in DOM tree. If there are differences, it will update the actual DOM. By optimizing the comparison algorithm, it can perform extremely fast since it does not need to search the whole DOM tree for nodes and properties. 4. Modifying Firefox’s DOM method implementation4.1. Logging FrameworkFirefox provide a “simple” logging service, located at dom\\accessible\\Logging.h (header file). This is recommended way to log anything to Firefox’s browser console. To use it, you need to do the following: #include “mozilla&#x2F;Logging.h”static mozilla::LazyLogModule sFooLog(“foo”); LazyLogModule will be initialized safely, even if the current class is already initialize an instance of LazyLogModule. Later, using these method appropriately to log: from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer\\_guide/Gecko\\_Logging Name Description MOZ_LOG(module, level, message) Outputs the given message if the module has the given log level enabled.+ module - The log module to use.+ level - The log level of the message.+ message - A printf-style message to output. Must be enclosed in parentheses. MOZ_LOG_TEST(module, level) Checks if the module has the given level enabled.+ module - The log module to use.+ level - The output level of the message. 4.2. AnalyzeThe requirement for my project is simple: To know how many time a dom method is called (for a specific website, and average for a set of common website) In fact, I cannot use Firefox own logging framework, because of these problems: Gecko source code is full of old logs and developer notes. Each log must provide a log level, which is not applicable for my project. Cannot count the logged text without writing another piece of tool. Example of old logs and developer notes from mozilla-central\\dom\\base\\nsINode.cpp, line 2585 to line 2609 Element* nsINode::GetElementById(const nsAString&amp; aId) { MOZ_ASSERT(!IsShadowRoot(), “Should use the faster version”); MOZ_ASSERT(IsElement() || IsDocumentFragment(), “Bogus this object for GetElementById call”); if (IsInUncomposedDoc()) { MOZ_ASSERT(IsElement(), “Huh? A fragment in a document?”); return FindMatchingElementWithId(aId, *AsElement(), *OwnerDoc()); } if (ShadowRoot* containingShadow &#x3D; AsContent()-&gt;GetContainingShadow()) { MOZ_ASSERT(IsElement(), “Huh? A fragment in a ShadowRoot?”); return FindMatchingElementWithId(aId, *AsElement(), *containingShadow); } for (nsIContent* kid &#x3D; GetFirstChild(); kid; kid &#x3D; kid-&gt;GetNextNode(this)) { if (!kid-&gt;IsElement()) { continue; } nsAtom* id &#x3D; kid-&gt;AsElement()-&gt;GetID(); if (id &amp;&amp; id-&gt;Equals(aId)) { return kid-&gt;AsElement(); } } return nullptr;} 5. Development5.1. Design solutionMy solution is simple. Log into an array, then count for each time a function name is repeated. First, I created a class to hold each record class DomLogNode{public: DomLogNode(); void setNode(string name, int count); int increaseCount(); bool compareName(string nameToCompare); int getCount(); string getName(); private: string functionName; int count;}; Then, I created another class to hold the list of record. This class is static static class DomLog{public: void recordLog(string functionName); void pushNewName(string functionName, int initialCount &#x3D; 1); void getDomLogs(); void exportFile(string path); private: vector domLogs;} domLog; Method exportFile(string path) write the list to a csv file, using simple c++ file library. Get the caller method nameIn cpp, to get the current method name, we can use the static variable __func__ as stated here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/func You can get the whole source code at my Github repository 5.2. Firefox integrationUnfortunately, the Firefox source code system (using mercurial source control) is buggy lately. It close the connection way before the clone process finished. Firefox implement DOM API all over the source code. For example, the API getElementById is implemented in 3 different places: dom\\base\\AnonymousContent.h with corresponding implementation dom\\base\\DocumentOrShadowRoot.h with corresponding implementation dom\\base\\nsINode.h with corresponding implementation The method inside nsdINode have a comment &#x2F;&#x2F; Document and ShadowRoot override this with its own (faster) version.&#x2F;&#x2F; This should really only be called for elements and document fragments. This mean, to correctly record how many time the GetElementById is called, we have to modify the code of all 3 methods. domLog.recordLog(__func__); This quickly getting out of hand, since there are hundreds of DOM API we need to log, and I am still looking for another solution.","categories":[{"name":"CPlusPlus","slug":"CPlusPlus","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CPlusPlus/"}],"tags":[{"name":"firefox","slug":"firefox","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/firefox/"},{"name":"DOM API","slug":"DOM-API","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/DOM-API/"},{"name":"Log","slug":"Log","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Log/"}]},{"title":"[Machine Learning] - 3.1 - Classification and Representation","slug":"machine-learning-1-3-classification-and-representation","date":"2019-05-14T09:43:52.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.569Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/05/14/machine-learning-1-3-classification-and-representation/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/05/14/machine-learning-1-3-classification-and-representation/","excerpt":"Tuần 3 trong course Machine Learning của giáo sư Andrew Ng trên Coursera.","text":"Tuần 3 trong course Machine Learning của giáo sư Andrew Ng trên Coursera. 1.

Decision BoundaryDựa vào Logistic function ở trên, ta có thể `biến đổi` hàm hypothesis của ta lại thành như sau: $latex h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\Rightarrow y &#x3D; 1$ $latex h_\\theta(x) &lt; 0.5 \\Rightarrow y &#x3D; 0$ Function g(z) hoạt động như sau: $latex g(z) \\geq 0.5$when$latex z \\geq 0$ Nhớ rằng: $latex z&#x3D;0, e^{0}&#x3D;1 \\Rightarrow g(z)&#x3D;1&#x2F;2$$latex z \\to \\infty, e^{-\\infty} \\to 0 \\Rightarrow g(z)&#x3D;1$$latex z \\to -\\infty, e^{\\infty}\\to \\infty \\Rightarrow g(z)&#x3D;0$ Như vậy, ta có thể viết: $latex h_\\theta(x) &#x3D; g(\\theta^T x) \\geq 0.5$when$latex \\theta^T x \\geq 0$ Từ những phát biểu trên, ta có thể viết $latex \\theta^T x \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow y &#x3D; 1$$latex \\theta^T x &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow y &#x3D; 0$ Decision Boundary chính là đường phân chia vùng y &#x3D; 0 và vùng y &#x3D; 1, được tạo ra bởi hàm hypothesis của chúng ta 2. Ví dụTa có ví dụ sau: $latex \\theta &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix}5\\\\ -1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$$latex y &#x3D; 1 \\; if \\; 5 + (-1) x_1 + 0 x_2 \\geq 0$$latex 5 - x_1 \\geq 0$$latex - x_1 \\geq -5$$latex x_1 \\leq 5$ vậy đồ thị của chúng ta sẽ giống như sau Lưu ý rằng tùy vào hàm hypothesis và các tham số theta, hình dáng boudary line có thể thay đổi tương ứng","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"[Travel] - Transportation in Europe","slug":"transportation-in-europe","date":"2019-05-01T09:59:14.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/05/01/transportation-in-europe/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/05/01/transportation-in-europe/","excerpt":"Nếu bạn có dư dả thời gian và nguồn kinh phí eo hẹp, thì cách tốt nhất để dạo vòng quanh các nước EU chính là các phương tiện công cộng.","text":"Nếu bạn có dư dả thời gian và nguồn kinh phí eo hẹp, thì cách tốt nhất để dạo vòng quanh các nước EU chính là các phương tiện công cộng. 1.

Có hãng rẻ và có hãng mắc, nhưng cũng có hãng rẻ nhưng xịn. 1.1. Canh véKhông giống với các loại vé 0đ của Jet Star hay VietJet, giá vé bay xuyên lục địa sẽ lên xuống theo một chu kỳ nào đó. Mình khuyên nên canh vé trước khi lên lịch chuyến đi. Các website tin cậy mình hay dùng để so sánh giá giữa các hãng với nhau là SkyScanner và Google Flights. Bạn có thể canh giá một chuyến cụ thể. Thời gian dư dả càng nhiều (tháng), thì cơ hội mua được vé rẻ của bạn càng cao. Tips: Khi check-in online, bạn có thể chọn ghế thoải mái nhất cho mình ở trang SeatGuru 1.2. Bảo hiểm thanh toánMột số hãng bay giá rẻ thường có nguy cơ…phá sản. Nếu bạn thanh toán bằng thẻ tín dụng, thì nên kiểm tra xem trong số các benefit của thẻ có bảo hiểm thanh toán không. Nếu có, bạn có thể được hoàn tiền hoặc bồi thường khi có vấn đề xảy ra với chuyến bay của bạn. Nếu trường hợp này xảy ra, hãy liên hệ với hãng bay + ngân hàng phát hành thẻ của bạn sớm nhất có thể. Một ví dụ về hãng bay phá sản 1.3. DelayỞ EU có luật: nếu chuyến bay trong EU bị delay quá 2 tiếng, hãng bay sẽ phải bồi thường cho bạn từ 200e đến 600e Bạn có thể tham khảo thêm tại đây 2. Train và BusĐối với mỗi thành phố sẽ có hệ thống bus và metro riêng. Nhiều nơi có nhiều hệ thống cùng hoạt động đan xen (như Paris chẳng hạn). Để tìm ra phương tiện phù hợp, mình thường tìm đường bằng google map. 2.1. Tìm đườngVí dụ: để tìm đường từ Orly Airport về 5 Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau 2.2. Đọc kết quảCó tới 4 kết quả trong hình, chọn cái nào? Tới đây thì kinh nghiệm cá nhân của bạn sẽ có chỗ sử dụng. Nếu bạn chưa đi bất kỳ cái nào, thì bạn phải research một chút rồi. Trong hình, bạn có thể thấy có nhiều hệ thống khác nhau M: Metro - hệ thống tàu điện ngầm chạy dưới lòng paris RER: “Express” train: hệ thống tàu (có ngầm và có chạy trên đường ray mặt đất) “tốc hành” của paris (dù nó ghi tốc hành nhưng rất thường xuyên bị delay). OrlyBus: Hệ thống bus đi từ sân bay Orly OrlyVal: Tàu điện tốc hành đi từ các trạm cố định tới sân bay và ngược lại Thường thì các phương tiện công cộng ở EU sẽ có những cái máy bán vé tự động đặt ở các trạm lớn. Với mỗi hệ thống sẽ có các quy định riêng. Sau đây là kinh nghiệm của mình. 2.2.1. Sophia - Antibes, FranceỞ Sophia, hệ thống bus là EnviBus màu hồng chói lóa. Ticket có thể mua theo block 10 vé hoặc 7 ngày. Tham khảo thêm tại EnviBus All tickets Ticket khi validate sẽ có giá trị theo thời gian. Bạn có thể dùng lại ticket đó đi bất kỳ chuyến bus nào của envibus trong vòng 60 phút. Mua vé tại chỗ trên xe thì 1.5 e. Mua trước thì 1 e, mua block 10 vé thì còn 8 e. 2.2.2. Nice, FranceTương tự, hệ thống bus ở Nice cũng có bán vé 1 ngày, có thể đi được Tram, Bus, Créabus 2.2.3. Salzburg, AustriaỞ Salzburg (hay là ở Austria nói chung thì mình ko rõ), hệ thống tàu rất phát triển. Thậm chí đi từ Vienna về Salzburg cũng có thể đi bằng tàu. Tới nỗi sân bay Salzburg nó vắng hoe, cả năm chưa đón tới 2 triệu lượt khách. Vé bus ở Salzburg cũng có nhiều dạng, tương ứng với nhiều mức di chuyển khác nhau. Mình thường mua 24-hours pass giá 4 e (đi được tất cả các chuyến bus trong 24h kể từ lúc validate). Ở đây thì giá vé ticket lại dựa trên tình trạng của bạn (trẻ em, người già, học sinh sinh viên) Người trưởng thành thì phải mua vé Full Fair. Vé xe bus ở Salzburg có dải chỉ óng ánh Đi Hallstatt từ Salzburg Có nhiều cách đi tới Hallstatt. Mình đi bus &gt; train &gt; ferry Bus 150 từ Salzburg Central Train station &gt; Bad Ischl Train từ Bad Ischl tới Hallstat Bahnhof Đi phà từ Hallstatt Bahnhof tới làng cổ 2.2.4. Paris, FranceParis bị chia thành 5 zone khác nhau. Trung tâm nằm ở zone 1. Đối với các loại vé, bạn phải chọn zone phù hợp. Cái này không hiển thị trên google map. Điều khủng khiếp là Orly Airport (sân bay nội địa ở Paris) nằm ở zone 4, sân bay Charle de Gaulle (sân bay quốc tế) nằm ở zone 5. Nếu bạn mua vé tại sân bay Orly, thì chỉ mua được vé bus cho zone 1-4 (không chọn được zone thấp hơn) Vé orlyval giá rất chát. Mình thường mua vé 1 day pass cho hệ thống RATP (đi được Orly, OrlyBus, RER, Metro) zone 1-4. Khi cần ra sân bay Charle de Gaulle, may là máy bán vé tự động có bán vé tới tận sân bay (Airport ticket), mà giá tới 10.3 e (đã có thuế). RER B tới Charle de Gaulle bị delay tại mỗi trạm rất dữ dội. Đó là các kinh nghiệm xương máu mình rút ra được sau khi bị phạt 35e vì mua vé đi không đúng zone ;( 3. Xài google map3.1. Double checkĐôi khi google map suggest cho bạn một con đường xa hơn, dài hơn và đắt hơn (ví dụ như đi từ Salzburg tới Hallstatt) Mình từng đứng ngay trạm metro ở Châtelet - Les Halles để đi tới Charle de Gaulle và thử refresh kết quả thì nó lại suggest một tuyến đường hoàn toàn khác. Nguyên nhân có thể do bạn mất sóng, mất GPS, hoặc thuật toán chưa đủ thông minh. 3.2. Đem sạc dự phòngGoogle map trong chế độ track theo đường đi nó rất tốn pin. Vậy nên thường mình ko bấm start tracking, mà chỉ xem trạm cuối cùng ở đâu, rồi để ý thông báo trên bus - train, lúc gần tới thì bật map lên check thôi. 3.3. Bus routeBus route trên google map nó ko khớp hoàn toàn với đường đi thực tế của bus. Nó chỉ trùng trạm dừng (mà đôi khi cũng ko trùng nữa)","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"bus","slug":"bus","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/bus/"},{"name":"europe","slug":"europe","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/europe/"},{"name":"train","slug":"train","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/train/"},{"name":"travel","slug":"travel","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/travel/"}]},{"title":"[Research] - LaTex on Windows - Step by step installation","slug":"latex-on-windows-step-by-step-installation","date":"2019-04-02T06:21:51.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/02/latex-on-windows-step-by-step-installation/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2019/04/02/latex-on-windows-step-by-step-installation/","excerpt":"In this blog, I will instruct you on how to install and writing LaTex documents on Windows with ease. 1.

Requirement1.1 List of softwareFirst thing first, you would need to download and install a series of software. Choose the correct version with your windows (x86&#x2F;x64) StrawberryPerl Visual Studio Code (text editor, not confused with Visual Studio IDE) MikTex (easier to install and use) For me, MikTex is kinda difficult to download. The server close connection every 30-45 secs. If this happened to you, use a download manager. For example: Free Download Manager 1.2 Installing MikTexAccept all default option, and wait for the installation completed. Start &gt; MikTex Console &gt; Updates &gt; Check for updates In case of difficult in download packages, you can change ‘Install from’ option with a http repository Install latexmk package 2. Setup on Visual Studio CodeIf you are opening Visual Studio Code while installing MikTex and Perl ActiveState, please CLOSE Visual Studio Code and open it again. Open Extension &gt; search for Latex &gt; Install LaTeX Workshop 3. Writing on Visual Studio CodeIt is recommended to create a folder for each LaTeX document (to store images, charts, data file, etc). Open that folder with Visual Studio Code, create a new file ended with .tex Open that .tex file, then you can start playing with your LaTeX To preview the rendered PDF, you can click on small icon on the top-right corner 4. CollaborationOkay okay, it’s cool, but why do I need to write LaTeX offline, using Visual Studio Code, instead of the awesome Overleaf? The answer is the price. For collaboration, overleaf offer 80 USD&#x2F;year for 6 students (the price is higher if you don’t have student account). With visual studio code, it’s free, and super fast too. 4.1 VSCode Live ShareLive Share is an amazing feature offered by Microsoft. It’s not even share files, it’s also share folders and projects. To begin with, install VS Live Share extension 4.2 Start CollaborationAfter installation complete, a new feature appeared in VSCode Click on that Live Share feature, then Start collaboration session...

Gradient DescentThuật toán Gradient Descent có 2 bước: Tính bộ giá trị $latex \\theta$ Thay vào cost function để kiểm tra hội tụ Để cho đơn giản, ta sẽ giả định rằng chỉ có 2 feature là $latex x_0 &#x3D; 1$ và $latex x_1$ (n &#x3D; 2) Công thức: $latex \\theta_j &#x3D; \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_j^{(i)}$ Ta tách công thức trên thành 2 phần: $latex \\theta_j &#x3D; \\theta_j - gradient$ với $latex gradient &#x3D; \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_j^{(i)}$ với: X &#x3D; $latex \\begin{bmatrix}x_0^{(1)} &amp; x_1^{(1)} \\\\x_0^{(2)} &amp; x_1^{(2)} \\\\ … &amp; … \\\\ x_0^{(m)} &amp; x_1^{(m)} \\end{bmatrix}$ $latex \\theta &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_0 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{bmatrix}$ y &#x3D; $latex \\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ … \\\\ y_m \\end{bmatrix}$ Tương tự như cost function, ta có: $latex (X\\times\\theta - y)&#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_0x_0^{(1)}+\\theta_1x_1^{(1)}-y_1 \\\\ \\theta_0x_0^{(2)}+\\theta_1x_1^{(2)}-y_2 \\\\ … \\\\ \\theta_0x_0^{(m)}+\\theta_1x_1^{(m)}-y_m \\end{bmatrix}&#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ … \\\\ a_m \\end{bmatrix}&#x3D; a$ với a là vector m x 1 Nhân với $latex x_j^{(i)}$ và tính tổng Đối với mỗi tham số của vector a, ta nhân nó với x tương ứng, rồi cộng tất cả các kết quả lại. Để vừa nhân, vừa tính tổng và trả về một vector chứa kết quả là các giá trị của gradient, ta sẽ phải biến đổi matrix X một chút. $latex X^T &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix}x_0^{(1)} &amp; x_0^{(2)} &amp; … &amp; x_0^{(m)}\\\\ x_1^{(1)} &amp; x_1^{(2)} &amp; … &amp; x_1^{(m)}\\end{bmatrix}$ Khi nhân matrix này với vector a, ta sẽ có kết quả như mong muốn. $latex X^T\\times a &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix}x_0^{(1)} &amp; x_0^{(2)} &amp; … &amp; x_0^{(m)}\\\\ x_1^{(1)} &amp; x_1^{(2)} &amp; … &amp; x_1^{(m)}\\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ … \\\\ a_m \\end{bmatrix}&#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a_1x_0^{(1)} + a_2x_0^{(2)} + … + a_mx_0^{(m)} \\\\ a_1x_1^{(1)} + a_2x_1^{(2)} + … + a_mx_1^{(m)} \\end{bmatrix}$ Code: file gradientDescent.m function [theta, J_history] = gradientDescent(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters) %GRADIENTDESCENT Performs gradient descent to learn theta % theta = GRADIENTDESCENT(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters) updates theta by % taking num_iters gradient steps with learning rate alpha % Initialize some useful values m = length(y); % number of training examples J_history = zeros(num_iters, 1); for iter = 1:num_iters gradient = (alpha/m) * X&#x27; * (X*theta - y); theta = theta - gradient; % Save the cost J in every iteration J_history(iter) = computeCost(X, y, theta); end end Code này có thể dùng chung cho gradient descent với nhiều feature 5.

TrickÁp dụng các kiến thức về phép nhân matrix đã học ở bài trước, ta có như sau $latex h_0(x) &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_0 &amp; \\theta_1 &amp; … &amp; \\theta_n \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ … \\\\ x_n \\end{bmatrix} &#x3D; \\theta^Tx$ Trên đây là công thức của hàm hypothesis được rút gọn thành phép nhân matrix với vector. 2. Gradient Descent cho Multiple VariablesCông thức cho thuật toán Gradient Descent thì y hệt như cũ. Ta chỉ lặp lại nó cho n features mà thôi. Lặp lại cho tới khi hội tụ: $latex \\theta_0 :&#x3D; \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_0^{(i)} \\\\ \\theta_1 :&#x3D; \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_1^{(i)} \\\\ \\theta_2 :&#x3D; \\theta_2 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_2^{(i)} \\\\ …$ hoặc diễn giải theo một cách khác: $latex \\theta_j :&#x3D; \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_j^{(i)}$ với j:&#x3D; 0…n Đối với $latex \\theta_0$, $latex x^i_0 &#x3D; 1$ 3. Gradient Descent in Practice3.1. Feature Scaling và Mean NormalizationKhi các features có giá trị giao động trong các khoảng cách xa nhau, thì thuật toán Gradient Descent thường tốn nhiều thơi gian để tìm ra kết quả. Ví dụ ta có 2 feature là diện tích nhà và số phòng ngủ: [code lang&#x3D;text] 200 &lt; Diện tích nhà &lt; 2000 1 &lt; Số phòng ngủ &lt; 5 [&#x2F;code] Nếu vẽ đồ thị cho hàm hypothesis dự đoán giá nhà, bạn sẽ thấy nó là một dạng đồ thị hình cái tô với đáy rất nhọn, nhưng dẹp. Điều này làm cho mỗi step của gradient descent trải dài về bề ngang, nhưng không đi nhanh về điểm hội tụ, làm tổng thời gian chạy thuật toán gradient descent tăng lên. hình ảnh chỉ mang tính chất minh họa ;) Ta có thể tăng tốc gradient descent bằng cách biến đổi các giá trị của feature cho nó nằm trong một khoảng gần giống nhau. Lý do là $latex \\theta$ sẽ di chuyển nhanh hơn trong vùng bé hơn và ngược lại, chậm hơn trong vùng lớn hơn. Nhìn chung, ta sẽ biến đổi sao cho: $latex -1 \\leq x_{(i)} \\leq 1$ hoặc $latex -0.5 \\leq x_{(i)} \\leq 0.5$ Trên đây chỉ là ví dụ, mục tiêu là làm cho vùng giá trị của các feature càng gần nhau càng tốt. 2 kỹ thuật để làm chuyện này là Feature Scaling và Mean Normalization. Feature Scaling là chia input với khoảng giá trị (max - min). Mean Normalization là input - giá trị trung bình của input. $latex x_i :&#x3D; \\frac{x_i - \\mu_i}{\\delta_i}$ với: $latex \\mu_i$: trung bình của feature i $latex \\delta_i$: Max - min hoặc độ lệch chuẩn Max - min sẽ cho ra kết quả rất khác với độ lệch chuẩn. 3.2. Learning RateĐể xác định tham số $latex \\alpha$, ta có thể áp dụng 1 số kỹ thuật: Vẽ đồ thị với trục x &#x3D; số bước lặp của gradient descent, trục y &#x3D; giá trị của $latex J(\\theta)$. Nếu $latex J(\\theta)$ tăng, thì bạn phải giảm giá trị $latex \\alpha$ xuống và làm lại từ đầu. Automatic convergence test: Xác định điểm hội tụ khi giá trị $latex J(\\theta)$ không vượt quá E trong một lần lặp, với E là một giá trị rất nhỏ nào đó. Tuy nhiên trong thực tế, thường rất khó xác định giá trị E này. Người ta đã chứng minh được rằng, nếu learning rate $latex \\alpha$ đủ nhỏ, thì giá trị $latex J(\\theta)$ sẽ giảm sau mỗi lần lặp. Túm lại: * Nếu $latex \\alpha$ quá nhỏ: gradient descent chạy lâu. * Nếu $latex \\alpha$ quá lớn: $latex J(\\theta)$ có thể sẽ không giảm sau mỗi lần lặp -&gt; không hội tụ. 4. Features và Polynomial RegressionTa có thể cải thiện features và dạng của hàm hypothesis bằng nhiều cách. Một trong số những cách đó là kết hợp các feature lại với nhau. Ví dụ như khi ta có 2 feature là dài và rộng, ta có thể kết hợp chúng thành diện tích = dài * rộng. Ngoài ra, không phải lúc nào ta cũng có thể sử dụng được hàm hypothesis là một đường thẳng, nhất là khi nó không “vừa” với bộ data. Lúc này, có thể biến đổi nó một chút, hoặc bẻ cong nó bằng cách nâng lũy thừa, hoặc lấy căn của các features (hoặc bất cứ dạng nào khác đều được). Ví dụ: $latex h_{\\theta}(x) &#x3D; \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1$ Ta có thể thêm 1 feature mới bằng cách lũy thừa x lên: $latex h_{\\theta}(x) &#x3D; \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_1^2$ hoặc lấy căn của nó: $latex h_{\\theta}(x) &#x3D; \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2\\sqrt{x_1}$ Một điều quan trọng là khi bạn biến đổi các feature như thế này, vùng giá trị của nó sẽ trở nên cách biệt so với feature gốc. Lúc này, bạn sẽ phải áp dụng những cách tối ưu như Feature Scaling và Mean Normalization đã nói ở trên để tối ưu thuật toán Gradient Descent.","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Machine Learning - 1.4 - Matrices and Vectors","slug":"machine-learning-matrices-and-vectors","date":"2018-10-01T11:47:01.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/10/01/machine-learning-matrices-and-vectors/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/10/01/machine-learning-matrices-and-vectors/","excerpt":"Bài viết thứ 4 trong loạt bài tự học Machine Learning trên Coursera của giáo sư Andrew Ng.

Phần mềmĐể thử nghiệm nhanh chóng các giả thuyết - thuật toán liên quan tới toán học trong Machine Learning, ta có thể dùng một phần mềm mang tên Octave Bạn có thể chạy đoạn code dưới đây trong Octave hoặc Matlab [code lang&#x3D;matlab] % The ; denotes we are going back to a new row. A &#x3D; [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12] % Initialize a vector v &#x3D; [1;2;3] % Get the dimension of the matrix A where m &#x3D; rows and n &#x3D; columns [m,n] &#x3D; size(A) % You could also store it this way dim_A &#x3D; size(A) % Get the dimension of the vector v dim_v &#x3D; size(v) % Now let’s index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A A_23 &#x3D; A(2,3) [&#x2F;code] 3. Các phép tính3.1. Phép cộng và phép nhân matrix số thựcĐối với phép cộng và nhân, chỉ cần đơn giản cộng và nhân với mỗi phần tử của matrix. $latex \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} +\\begin{bmatrix} w &amp; x \\\\ y &amp; z \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} &#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a+w &amp; b+x \\\\ c+y &amp; d+z \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ Tương tự đối với phép nhân và chia: $latex \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} * x &#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a*x &amp; b*x \\\\ c*x &amp; d*x \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ $latex \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} &#x2F; x &#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a &#x2F;x &amp; b&#x2F;x \\\\ c &#x2F;x &amp; d &#x2F;x \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ 3.2. Nhân matrix với vectorĐể nhân một matrix với một vector, nhân mỗi phần tử rồi cộng kết quả: $latex \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ e &amp; f \\end{bmatrix} *\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} &#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a*x + b*y \\\\ c*x + d*y \\\\ e*x + f*y\\end{bmatrix}$ Một matrix m x n nhân với một vector n x 1 sẽ ra kết quả là một vector m x 1. Kiến thức về matrix này có thể áp dụng vào hàm hypothesis của linear regression: Ta có bộ input các giá trị của x như sau: [code lang&#x3D;text] x1 &#x3D; 21 x2 &#x3D; 30 x3 &#x3D; 25 x4 &#x3D; 22 [&#x2F;code] hàm hypothesis: $latex h_{0} &#x3D; -40 + 0.25x$ Để tính nhanh các giá trị dự đoán của y, ta có thể tạo ra matrix x và vector hypothesis, và tạo thành phép tính như sau: $latex \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 21 \\\\ 1 &amp; 30 \\\\ 1 &amp; 25 \\\\ 1 &amp; 22 \\end{bmatrix} * \\begin{bmatrix} -40 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix}$ Phép tính này có thể dễ dàng tính toán bằng Octave [code lang&#x3D;matlab] A &#x3D; [1,21;1,30;1,25;1,22] B &#x3D; [-40;0.25] mul_AB &#x3D; A * B [&#x2F;code] Kết quả: [code lang&#x3D;matlab] A &#x3D; 1 21 1 30 1 25 1 22 B &#x3D; -40.00000 0.25000 mul_AB &#x3D; -34.750 -32.500 -33.750 -34.500 [&#x2F;code] 3.3. Nhân 2 matrix với nhauTương tự như việc nhân 1 matrix với 1 vector, bạn chỉ cần tách phép nhân 2 matrix thành nhiều phép nhân matrix với vector. $latex \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ e &amp; f \\end{bmatrix} *\\begin{bmatrix} w &amp; x \\\\ y &amp; z \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} &#x3D;\\begin{bmatrix} a*w + b*y &amp; a*x + b*z \\\\ c*w + d*y &amp; c*x + d*z \\\\ e*w + f*y &amp; e*x + f*z\\end{bmatrix}$ Một matrix m x n khi nhân với một matrix n x o sẽ cho ra kết quả là một matrix m x o. 3.4. Các tính chất của phép nhân matrixPhép nhân 2 số thực có một số tính chất không thể áp dụng với phép nhân 2 matrix. Gọi $latex A$ và $latex B$ là 2 matrix, ta có: $latex A \\times B \\neq B \\times A$ $latex A \\times B \\times C &#x3D; A \\times (B \\times C) &#x3D; (A \\times B) \\times C$ 3.5. Identity MatrixMột matrix bất kỳ khi nhân với một Identity matrix phù hợp sẽ có kết quả là chính nó. Ký hiệu: $latex I$ hoặc $latex I_{n \\times n}$ Ví dụ: $latex I_{1 \\times 1} &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ $latex I_{2 \\times 2} &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ $latex I_{3 \\times 3} &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ Lưu ý: $latex A \\times I &#x3D; I \\times A$ 4. Inverse (nghịch đảo) và Transpose (chuyển vị)4.1. Inverse (nghịch đảo) Một ví dụ với số thực 3 là một số thực. Ta có: $latex 3 \\times (3^{-1}) &#x3D; 1$ Tổng quát: $latex a \\times (a^{-1}) &#x3D; 1$ Ta có matrix A: $latex A \\times A^{-1} &#x3D; A^{-1} \\times A &#x3D; I$ Matrix gồm toàn các phần tử 0 không có nghịch đảo 4.2. Transpose (chuyển vị)Gọi B là matrix chuyển vị của A, ta có: $latex A &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ e &amp; f \\end{bmatrix}$ $latex A^T &#x3D; \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; c &amp; e \\\\ b &amp; d &amp; f \\end{bmatrix}$ Hay nói cách khác: $latex A_{ij} &#x3D; A^T_{ji}$","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"matrice","slug":"matrice","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/matrice/"},{"name":"matrix","slug":"matrix","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/matrix/"},{"name":"vector","slug":"vector","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/vector/"}]},{"title":"Machine Learning - 1.3 - Parameter Learning","slug":"machine-learning-parameter-learning","date":"2018-09-27T09:17:23.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/09/27/machine-learning-parameter-learning/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/09/27/machine-learning-parameter-learning/","excerpt":"Bài thứ 3 trong chuỗi bài viết tự học Machine Learning.

Gradient DescentỞ 2 bài trước, chúng ta đã có hàm hypothesis và cách để biết hàm đó có phù hợp với bộ training example của chúng ta hay ko. Bây giờ chúng ta sẽ tìm cách tìm ra các tham số cho hàm hypothesis, và đó là nhiệm vụ của Gradient Descent. Để đơn giản, trong phần này, ta sẽ xét các hàm hypothesis có 2 tham số là $latex \\theta_{0}$ và $latex \\theta_{1}$. Đối với các trường hợp có nhiều hơn 2 tham số, cách thực hiện là tương tự. 1.1. Biểu diễn đồ thịGọi $latex J(\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1})$ là kết quả của cost function. Ta biểu diễn các tham số lên một đồ thị có 3 trục x, y và z như sau: $latex \\theta_{0}$ là trục x. $latex \\theta_{1}$ là trục y. $latex J(\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1})$ là trục z. Các mũi tên đỏ chỉ những điểm thấp nhất của đồ thị này, đó là các điểm mà ta tìm kiếm (nhằm mục đích tối thiểu giá trị của cost function). 1.2. Mô tả thuật toánChọn 1 điểm bất kỳ, sau đó di chuyển từng bước nhỏ về vùng trũng nhất của đồ thị. Cách làm là lấy đạo hàm của cost function. Đối với một hàm số, đạo hàm của nó chính là đường tiếp tuyến của nó. Độ dốc của đường tiếp tuyến tại một điểm chính là giá trị của hàm đạo hàm tại điểm đó. Độ dốc này cho ta biết hướng đi để chọn điểm tiếp theo. Độ dài của mỗi step được xác định bởi tham số $latex \\alpha$, gọi là learning rate. Điểm ban đầu được chọn khác nhau sẽ cho ra các kết quả rất khác nhau. Hình bên trên có 2 điểm ban đầu khác nhau, và sẽ cho ra 2 điểm thấp nhất là 2 mũi tên đỏ. Như vậy, thuật toán Gradient Descent sẽ là: lặp lại cho tới khi hội tụ: $latex \\theta_{j} :&#x3D; \\theta_{j} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta_{j}}J(\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1})$ với: $latex j&#x3D;0,1,2,…,m$, đại diện cho index Với mỗi lần lặp, cả $latex \\theta_{0}$ và $latex \\theta_{1}$ phải được tính đồng thời. 1.3. Xây dựngĐể cho đơn giản, ta sẽ dùng hàm số chỉ có 1 biến $latex \\theta_{1}$ và từng bước xây dựng công thức cho Gradient Descent. Vậy công thức của ta còn: Lặp lại cho tới khi hội tụ: $latex \\theta_{1} :&#x3D; \\theta_{1} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta_{1}}J(\\theta_{1})$ với $latex \\alpha$ là learning rate $latex \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta_{1}}J(\\theta_{1})$ là độ dốc của đường tiếp tuyến (slope) tại $latex \\theta_{1}$ Nhìn vào đồ thị trên, khi slope nằm bên trái của điểm hội tụ, thì giá trị $latex \\theta_{1}$ tăng, và ngược lại khi nó nằm bên phải của điểm hội tụ. Tham số $latex \\alpha$ nên được điều chỉnh hợp lý sao cho thuật toán gradient descent hội tụ trong 1 khoảng thời gian phù hợp. Khi $latex \\alpha$ quá nhỏ, thời gian tìm đến điểm hội tụ sẽ lâu. Khi quá lớn, thuật toán rất có thể sẽ không tìm thấy điểm hội tụ. Với một tham số $latex \\alpha$ hợp lý, càng về gần điểm hội tụ, độ dốc của tiếp tuyến sẽ càng nhỏ, do đó, thuật toán gradient descent sẽ có bước đi nhỏ hơn, và sẽ bằng 0 khi tới điểm hội tụ. Trong trường hợp điểm xuất phát chính là điểm hội tụ, thì thuật toán gradient descent sẽ cho ra $latex \\theta_{1}$ không đổi với $latex \\alpha$ bất kỳ, vì đạo hàm của nó là 0. 2. Gradient Descent cho Linear RegressionKhi áp dụng thuật toán Gradient Descent vào hàm số Hypothesis của ta trong các bài viết trước, ta có thể tìm được 2 tham số $latex \\theta_{0}$ và $latex \\theta_{1}$: Lặp lại cho tới khi hội tụ: $latex \\theta_0 :&#x3D; \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i})$ $latex \\theta_1 :&#x3D; \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i&#x3D;1}^{m}\\left((h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) x_{i}\\right)$ với: m là tổng số training example. $latex \\theta_0$ tham số sẽ thay đổi đồng thời với $latex theta_1$ và $latex x_{i}$. $latex y_{i}$ là các giá trị được cho bởi bộ training example. Như vậy, số 2 dưới mẫu trong công thức của bài kỳ trước đã bị triệt tiêu vì đạo hàm Gradient Descent trong bài toán này thường được gọi là Batch Gradient Descent, vì nó tính tổng của tất cả các giá trị Hàm hypothesis của bài toán Linear Regression có hình dạng như một cái tô, và chỉ có 1 điểm hội tụ duy nhất.","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"gradient descent","slug":"gradient-descent","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/gradient-descent/"},{"name":"hypothesis","slug":"hypothesis","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/hypothesis/"}]},{"title":"Machine Learning - 1.2 - Model and Cost Function","slug":"ml-model-and-cost-function","date":"2018-09-22T16:48:34.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/09/22/ml-model-and-cost-function/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/09/22/ml-model-and-cost-function/","excerpt":"Bài thứ 2 trong chuỗi bài viết tự học Machine Learning Trong bài này, ta sẽ tìm hiểu về cost function, một function nhằm dự đoán giá trị output với một bộ các giá trị input&#x2F;output cho trước.","text":"Bài thứ 2 trong chuỗi bài viết tự học Machine Learning Trong bài này, ta sẽ tìm hiểu về cost function, một function nhằm dự đoán giá trị output với một bộ các giá trị input&#x2F;output cho trước.

Các ký hiệuChúng ta sẽ thống nhất 1 cách sử dụng các ký hiệu để biểu thị các thuộc tính của một bài toán. x(i) sẽ là giá trị đầu vào, cũng được gọi là input feature. y(i) sẽ là đầu ra mà ta cố dự đoán. Một cặp (x(i), y(i)) được gọi là một training example. Số lượng training example được gọi là m. Như vậy, i&#x3D;1,2,3,…,m Lưu ý rằng (i) chỉ là index của giá trị, không phải số lũy thừa Ta dùng ký tự X, Y để biểu thị vùng không gian của input và output Ví dụ: X = Y = ℝ Khi đưa ra một bộ dữ liệu training (training set), mục tiêu của chúng ta là tạo ra được 1 function h sao cho h(x) có thể dự đoán gần đúng nhất giá trị của y. h là viết tắt cho từ Hypothesis, lý do cho tên gọi này chỉ đơn thuần là vì xưa kia, người ta đặt tên cho nó như vậy, và nó chết tên luôn. Như vậy, process của chúng ta sẽ như sau: Khi y là một giá trị liên tục, ví dụ như giá nhà, giá cổ phiếu, thì đây là một regression problem. Khi y chỉ là một số lượng nhỏ các giá trị nhất định (true&#x2F;false - yes&#x2F;no), thì đây là một classification problem. 2. Cost FunctionChúng ta “tính toán” sự chính xác của hàm hypothesis bằng cách sử dụng 1 hàm số. Hàm số đó gọi là cost function. Trước khi đưa ra bất kỳ một công thức hay hàm số nào, hãy cùng tôi đào bới trong mớ kiến thức hỗn độn mà tôi chắc rằng sẽ giúp bạn hiểu ra nội dung cốt lõi của Cost Function. 2.1. Toán học2.1.1. Xác xuất và thống kê (Probability and Statistic)Trong xác xuất thống kê, có một khái niệm gọi là Gaussian Distributed. Đúng rồi, bạn không nhìn nhầm đâu. Gaussian cũng là một tính năng nổi tiếng của…Photoshop, khi mà nó làm nhiễu đi vùng được chọn. Tính năng đó gọi là Gaussian Blur. Trong lý thuyết xác xuất, phân phối chuẩn, hay còn gọi là phân phối Gauss, phân phối Gaussian, phân phối Laplace-Gauss, là một dạng phân phối xác xuất liên tục (Continuous probability distribution). Sở dĩ tôi nhắc tới phân phối chuẩn là bởi vì theo định lý giới hạn trung tâm (Central limit theorem), ở dạng tổng quát nhất của phân phối chuẩn, phân phối của tổng rất nhiều biến ngẫu nhiên độc lập sẽ có phân phối xấp xỉ chuẩn. Tức là, số lượng training example càng nhiều thì mỗi một training example sẽ có giá trị càng gần với hàm hypothesis của chúng ta. Tóm lại, ta sẽ chọn tham số sao cho khoảng cách từ đồ thị của hàm hypothesis tới y của các training example là ngắn nhất. 2.1.2. Phương sai (Variance) Trong lý thuyết xác suất và thống kê, phương sai của một biến ngẫu nhiên là một độ đo sự phân tán thống kê của biến đó, nó hàm ý các giá trị của biến đó thường ở cách giá trị kỳ vọng bao xa. Theo định nghĩa này của phương sai, đồ thị biểu diễn các giá trị kỳ vọng chính là đồ thị hàm hypothesis của chúng ta đó. Phương sai chính là giá trị mà ta muốn nó càng nhỏ càng tốt Phương sai của một biến ngẫu nhiên là bình phương của độ lệch chuẩn. Như đã nói ở phần trước, khi mà tập giá trị đầu vào training example của chúng ta đủ lớn, thì ta có thể xem mỗi training example là một biến ngẫu nhiên có phân phối chuẩn. Vậy ta có: Tập hợp kỳ vọng &#x3D; hypothesis $h_\\theta(x)&#x3D;\\theta_0+\\theta_1x$ Độ lệch chuẩn: $latex h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}$ Phương sai &#x3D; (độ lệch chuẩn)2 Vậy phương sai của tập hợp các training example sẽ là: $latex \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$ Nhiệm vụ của ta là tìm ra giá trị nhỏ nhất của công thức trên. 2.2. Đạo hàm (Derivative)Để tìm giá trị lớn nhất &#x2F; nhỏ nhất của một hàm số, ta có thể sử dụng đạo hàm. 2.2.1. Một ví dụ toán họcMột trái banh được ném lên trời. Độ cao của trái banh so với mặt đất tại bất kỳ thời điểm t nào được tính bởi công thức: h &#x3D; 3 + 14t -5t2 Vậy độ cao lớn nhất của trái banh là bao nhiêu? Ứng dụng đạo hàm, ta giải bài toán này như sau: $latex \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}t}h&#x3D;0+14-5(2t)&#x3D;14-10t$ Hàm số trên biểu thị mức độ thay đổi của độ cao h tại thời điểm t. Như vậy, tại độ cao lớn nhất, _mức độ thay đổi độ cao h &#x3D; 0 (vì trái banh không tiếp tục bay cao lên nữa mà bắt đầu rơi xuống). Vậy ta có: [code lang&#x3D;text] 14-10t &#x3D; 0 =&gt; t &#x3D; 1.4 [&#x2F;code] Vậy độ cao lớn nhất là [code lang&#x3D;text] h &#x3D; 3 + 14x1.4 - 10x1.4x1.4 &#x3D; 12.8 [&#x2F;code] 2.2.2. Lớn nhất hay nhỏ nhấtLàm sao ta biết được một hàm số sẽ có giá trị lớn nhất hay nhỏ nhất? Nếu dựa vào đồ thị thì quả là một cách tốn nhiều thời gian và công sức. Tại đây, ta tiếp tục sử dụng đạo hàm (một lần nữa): [code lang&#x3D;text] f’(t) &#x3D; 14 - 10t với t &#x3D; 1.4 thì f’(t) &#x3D; 0 =&gt; f’’(t) &#x3D; -10 với t &#x3D; 1.4 thì f’’(t) &#x3D; -10 [&#x2F;code] Đây gọi là Second Derivative Test, phát biểu như sau: Khi một hàm số có mức độ thay đổi &#x3D; 0 tại điểm x, thì giá trị hàm đạo hàm lần 2 của hàm số đó tại x nếu: Nhỏ hơn 0: đó là giá trị lớn nhất. Lớn hơn 0: đó là giá trị nhỏ nhất. Bằng 0: chưa thể tìm được giá trị lớn nhất&#x2F;nhỏ nhất của hàm số. 2.3. Công thứcÁp dụng cả 2 phần đạo hàm và toán bên trên, ta sẽ có: $latex \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$ với $latex h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) &#x3D; \\theta_{0} + \\theta_{1}x^{(i)}$ Lý do của số 2 dưới mẫu số là để triệt tiêu khi ta làm đạo hàm. Nhìn chung, nó không ảnh hưởng tới kết quả, vì mục tiêu là tìm giá trị nhỏ nhất của hàm số trên. Vậy ta sẽ tìm giá trị của $latex \\theta_{0}$ và $latex \\theta_{1}$ để hàm số trên nhỏ nhất.","categories":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Machine-Learning/"}],"tags":[{"name":"cost function","slug":"cost-function","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/cost-function/"}]},{"title":"Machine Learning - 1.1 - Introduction","slug":"machine-learning-introduction","date":"2018-09-14T15:22:30.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/09/14/machine-learning-introduction/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/09/14/machine-learning-introduction/","excerpt":"Bài viết mở đầu cho chuỗi tự học Machine Learning.

Machine learning là gìCó 2 định nghĩa về machine learning: The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Arthur Samuel Định nghĩa thứ 2: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Tom Mitchell Đọc thì có vẻ dài dòng, nhưng đưa nó vào một ví dụ là dễ hiểu ngay: Chơi cờ E(xperience): kinh nghiệm chơi cờ (càng chơi càng giỏi). T(ask): nhiệm vụ là chơi cờ. P(robability): Khả năng mà máy tính sẽ thắng trong ván tiếp theo. 2. Phân loạiMọi chương trình Machine learning đều có thể chia thành 2 loại: Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning 2.1. Supervised LearningTrong loại này, ta biết trước dữ liệu đầu vào và kết quả. Hãy tưởng tượng nó như một dạng biểu đồ. Dựa vào biểu đồ này, ta có thể dự đoán mối quan hệ giữa input và output. Khi đó, khi đưa một input bất kỳ, ta có thể tính ra được output. Supervised learning được chia làm 2 loại là regression và classification. 2.1.1. RegressionDựa vào mối liên hệ giữa input và output, ta dự đoán được kết quả 2.1.2. ClassificationDựa vào đặc điểm của input, ta đặt được nó vào một loại cụ thể 2.2. Unsupervised LearningTrong “thể loại” machine learning này, ta hoàn toàn ko biết trước được kết quả sẽ như thế nào. Ví dụ: Trong 1 triệu bức ảnh, tìm cách nhóm các bức ảnh có cùng 1 chủ đề lại với nhau (nhà cửa, xe cộ, con người). Tìm và lọc ra tiếng người nói chuyện và tiếng nhạc trong 1 buổi tiệc ồn ào với nhiều loại âm thanh (Cocktail Party Algorithm).

DbContext của Entity Framework Core “Trước giờ xài mà có để ý DbContext là gì đâu” -&gt; đây chắc là tình trạng chung của kha khá công nghệ liên quan tới .NET, khi mà mọi thứ đã được xây dựng sẵn, và bạn chỉ có nhiệm vụ … xài DbContext là một thực thể đại diện cho một phiên làm việc với database, dùng để query và lưu dữ liệu của bạn Vì nó chỉ đại diện cho 1 phiên làm việc, trong ASP.NET, mỗi khi có 1 request mới từ browser, 1 DbContext mới sẽ được tạo ra, và sẽ bị dispose khi return response cho browser Thông thường, bạn sẽ kế thừa lại từ DbContext, nhét thêm các DbSet vào, từ đó mới query các kiểu được Bạn có thể tham khảo thêm về cách thiết lập DbContext ở đây, mục 3.2 1.1. DbContext Tracking Để đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn dữ liệu, DbContext dùng 1 cơ chế gọi là tracking. Khi bạn thay đổi 1 record (thêm, xóa, sửa), thì thay đổi đó ko được đưa xuống database ngay, mà sẽ còn vương vấn lại. DbContext sẽ theo dõi sự thay đổi này. Cho tới khi bạn đã thực hiện tất cả các thay đổi cần thiết, rồi gọi yourDbContext.SaveChanges(), thì lúc này, những thay đổi được track sẽ được ship xuống database. Vậy tất cả những điều này liên quan gì tới Repository và Unit of Work? DbContext là một implement của Repository và Unit of Work, chỉ có điều nó nằm sâu trong framework, còn implement của bạn sẽ nằm ở application 2. Repository Có cái sơ đồ hay ho sau Bạn có thể đọc thêm về các services được inject tại bài viết Dependency Injection trong ASP.NET Core Vậy đóa, Repository đóng vai trò là 1 lớp trung gian giữa Bussiness Logic Layer (controllers và services) và Data Access Layer (các DbContext) 2.1. Lý do Tách việc xử lý logic và việc truy cập database Dễ trace bug Dễ unit test Dễ thay đổi logic hoặc database Gom chung nhìu tác vụ cơ bản về 1 chỗ Ko phải viết đi viết lại 1 tác vụ nhiều lần 2.2. Implement Cụ tỉ, Repository sẽ có các nhiệm vụ: Liệt kê danh sách các record - Lấy 1 record - Thêm - Xóa - Sửa 1 record Bài toán: quản lý học sinh Tạo interface using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using ContosoUniversity.Models; namespace ContosoUniversity.DAL &#123; public interface IStudentRepository : IDisposable &#123; IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt; GetStudents(); Student GetStudentByID(int studentId); void InsertStudent(Student student); void DeleteStudent(int studentID); void UpdateStudent(Student student); void Save(); &#125; &#125; Đoạn code trên khai báo một bộ CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) kinh điển Tạo class implement using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Data; using ContosoUniversity.Models; namespace ContosoUniversity.DAL &#123; public class StudentRepository : IStudentRepository, IDisposable &#123; // SchoolContext kế thừa từ DbContext, và có thêm DbSet&lt;Student&gt; private SchoolContext context; public StudentRepository(SchoolContext context) &#123; this.context = context; &#125; public IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt; GetStudents() &#123; return context.Students.ToList(); &#125; public Student GetStudentByID(int id) &#123; return context.Students.Find(id); &#125; public void InsertStudent(Student student) &#123; context.Students.Add(student); &#125; public void DeleteStudent(int studentID) &#123; Student student = context.Students.Find(studentID); context.Students.Remove(student); &#125; public void UpdateStudent(Student student) &#123; context.Entry(student).State = EntityState.Modified; &#125; public void Save() &#123; context.SaveChanges(); &#125; private bool disposed = false; protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) &#123; if (!this.disposed) &#123; if (disposing) &#123; context.Dispose(); &#125; &#125; this.disposed = true; &#125; public void Dispose() &#123; Dispose(true); GC.SuppressFinalize(this); &#125; &#125; &#125; Inject repository này vào Controller hoặc Service (nhớ khai báo nó trong Startup.cs trước nhóe) public class StudentController &#123; private readonly IStudentRepository _studentRepository; public StudentController(IStudentRepository studentRepository) &#123; _studentRepository = studentRepository &#125; &#125; 2.3. Performance Hit Entity Framework khi query một record hoặc 1 bộ record nào đó trong database, nó sẽ trả về dạng IQueryable. Chỉ khi nào bạn gọi .ToList();, thì câu lệnh SQL mới được sinh ra và gửi tới database. Trong StudentRepository ở trên, nếu bạn muốn filter 1 list các student có tên là “ABC”, thì sẽ phải code trong controller như sau public IActionResult GetStudents(string name) &#123; // SQL đã được sinh ra, toàn bộ student trong db đã được trả về và lưu trong memory var allStudents = _studentRepository.GetStudents(); // filter này chỉ thực hiện việc filter trên memory var filteredStudents = allStudents.Where(x =&gt; x.Name.Contains(name)); return View(filteredStudents); &#125; Đây là 1 code rất tệ khi mà student có hàng triệu record, trong khi bạn chỉ cần 1 số ít các record mà thôi. Ở phần sau, bạn sẽ biết cách fix cho vấn đề này, đồng thời implement 1 generic repository cho các tác vụ CRUD cơ bản 3. Generic Repository Về cơ bản, ta sẽ dùng kiểu khai báo generic class của C# để implement generic repository using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Data; using System.Data.Entity; using ContosoUniversity.Models; using System.Linq.Expressions; namespace ContosoUniversity.DAL &#123; public class GenericRepository&lt;TEntity&gt; where TEntity : class &#123; // SchoolContext được kế thừa từ DbContext internal SchoolContext context; // Generic repository này sẽ hoạt động dựa trên entity được truyền vào khi đăng ký trong Startup.cs internal DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt; dbSet; public GenericRepository(SchoolContext context) &#123; this.context = context; this.dbSet = context.Set&lt;TEntity&gt;(); &#125; // Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; filter: cho phép bạn truyền vào một filter expression dạng LINQ public virtual IEnumerable&lt;TEntity&gt; Get( Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; filter = null, Func&lt;IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;, IOrderedQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;&gt; orderBy = null, string includeProperties = &quot;&quot;) &#123; IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt; query = dbSet; // Query là 1 dạng IQueryable, chỉ được thực thi khi cần giá trị list if (filter != null) &#123; query = query.Where(filter); &#125; // Tiếp theo, nó sẽ kèm theo các property cần thiết khi người dùng chỉ định foreach (var includeProperty in includeProperties.Split (new char[] &#123; &#x27;,&#x27; &#125;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)) &#123; query = query.Include(includeProperty); &#125; // Sau cùng, nó thực thi bằng cách translate thành câu lệnh SQL và gọi xuống database if (orderBy != null) &#123; return orderBy(query).ToList(); &#125; else &#123; return query.ToList(); &#125; &#125; // trong asp.net, Id cho 1 object có thể là GUID hoặc int public virtual TEntity GetByID(object id) &#123; return dbSet.Find(id); &#125; public virtual void Insert(TEntity entity) &#123; dbSet.Add(entity); &#125; // trong asp.net, Id cho 1 object có thể là GUID hoặc int public virtual void Delete(object id) &#123; TEntity entityToDelete = dbSet.Find(id); Delete(entityToDelete); &#125; public virtual void Delete(TEntity entityToDelete) &#123; if (context.Entry(entityToDelete).State == EntityState.Detached) &#123; dbSet.Attach(entityToDelete); &#125; dbSet.Remove(entityToDelete); &#125; public virtual void Update(TEntity entityToUpdate) &#123; dbSet.Attach(entityToUpdate); context.Entry(entityToUpdate).State = EntityState.Modified; &#125; &#125; &#125; 4. Tạo class Unit of Work Unit of Work chỉ có 1 nhiệm vụ duy nhất, đảm bảo tất cả các repository của bạn đều dùng chung một DbContext. Bằng cách này, khi thực hiện xong tất cả các tác vụ thay đổi database, bạn chỉ cần gọi DbContext.SaveChanges() 1 lần duy nhất, và các thay đổi đó sẽ được lưu lại trong database using System; using ContosoUniversity.Models; namespace ContosoUniversity.DAL &#123; public class UnitOfWork : IDisposable &#123; private SchoolContext context = new SchoolContext(); private GenericRepository&lt;Department&gt; departmentRepository; private GenericRepository&lt;Course&gt; courseRepository; // Kiểm tra xem repository đã được khởi tạo chưa public GenericRepository&lt;Department&gt; DepartmentRepository &#123; get &#123; if (this.departmentRepository == null) &#123; this.departmentRepository = new GenericRepository&lt;Department&gt;(context); &#125; return departmentRepository; &#125; &#125; // Kiểm tra xem repository đã được khởi tạo chưa public GenericRepository&lt;Course&gt; CourseRepository &#123; get &#123; if (this.courseRepository == null) &#123; this.courseRepository = new GenericRepository&lt;Course&gt;(context); &#125; return courseRepository; &#125; &#125; public void Save() &#123; context.SaveChanges(); &#125; private bool disposed = false; protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) &#123; if (!this.disposed) &#123; if (disposing) &#123; context.Dispose(); &#125; &#125; this.disposed = true; &#125; public void Dispose() &#123; Dispose(true); GC.SuppressFinalize(this); &#125; &#125; &#125; Bước tiếp theo là thay đổi code của controller để sử dụng class UnitOfWork vừa mới khởi tạo // Lấy data var courses = unitOfWork.CourseRepository.Get(includeProperties: &quot;Department&quot;); // Lấy và order data var departmentsQuery = unitOfWork.DepartmentRepository.Get(orderBy: q =&gt; q.OrderBy(d =&gt; d.Name)); // Insert var course = new Course(); course.Name = &quot;Test&quot;; ... unitOfWork.CourseRepository.Insert(course); unitOfWork.Save(); // Hủy unitOfWork.Dispose(); 5. Tổng kết Vậy là bạn đã hiểu khái niệm và cách khai báo Repository và Unit of Work pattern. Bạn cũng đã biết cách sử dụng lambda expression để query các data thỏa điều kiện mong muốn thông qua interface IQueryable.

Implementation 4. Register 4.1. Lifetime 4.2. Contructor Injection 4.3. Action Injection 4.4. Service trong Service 1. Vấn đềHãy tưởng tượng bạn muốn uống coca, nhà ko còn chai coca nào Bạn phải ra Circle K, đi lòng vòng trong cửa hàng để kiếm 1 chai coca, trả tiền, đi về Bạn có thể quên ko trả tiền Bạn có thể ko tìm thấy Circle K nào gần cả Bạn có thể ko tìm thấy chai coca nào trong circle k cả Bạn có thể lấy nhầm 1 chai xá xị chương dương thay vì coca Với Dependency Injection, mọi việc sẽ khác đi Bạn đưa tiền cho 1 thằng nhóc có nhiệm vụ chuyên đi mua nước ngọt cho khu xóm 5 phút sau, nó xuất hiện với chai coca của bạn Một người khác trong cùng khu xóm cũng có nhu cần gần giống bạn, nhưng họ muốn uống pepsi Thay vì cũng phải đi ra cửa hàng và tự mua pepsi và gặp các vấn đề như bạn gặp, họ cũng gọi thằng nhóc đó lại, và 5 phút sau, chai pepsi ướp lạnh ở trong tay họ. Thằng nhóc đó chính là 1 Service, và bạn phụ thuộc vô thằng nhóc đó để có nước ngọt uống 2. Lợi íchQuay trở lại với ví dụ trên, lợi ích của bạn khi dùng Service mua nước ngọt của thằng nhóc là gì? Bạn ko cần quan tâm thằng nhóc đó nó làm gì để có nước ngọt cho bạn Bạn có thể yêu cầu nhiều loại nước ngọt khác nhau mà ko cần biết hình dạng hay chỗ bán 3. Back to codeQuay trở lại với code, bạn sẽ implement DI như thế nào? 3.1. Interfacepublic interface IDrinkBuyer &#123; void BuyDrink(string name); &#125; Khi thằng nhóc mua nước ngọt ở bên trên đã già, nó sẽ muốn truyền lại nhiệm vụ mua nước ngọt cho 1 thằng nhóc khác, và cứ thể. Mọi thằng nhóc mua nước ngọt trong xóm đều sẽ có 1 phương thức cơ bản là BuyDrink chấp nhận 1 param là tên của loại nước cần mua Bạn đóng vai trò là WebApplication, sẽ gọi phương thức này để có nước ngọt uống 3.2. ImplementationNgười quản lý của mấy thằng nhóc mua nước ngọt này sẽ phân nhiệm vụ cho từng thằng nhóc 1 Nhóc A mua ở Circle K Nhóc B mua ở Vinmart Và họ sẽ implement như sau public class CircleKDrinkBuyer: IDrinkBuyer &#123; public void BuyDrink(string name) &#123; // Go to circle k // Find the -name- drink // Buy it and deliver &#125; &#125; public class VinmartDrinkBuyer: IDrinkBuyer &#123; public void BuyDrink(string name) &#123; // Go to Vinmart // Find the -name- drink // Buy it and deliver &#125; &#125; Thế là xong Khi nhà bạn gần Vinmart, người quản lý sẽ cử thằng nhóc B - VinmartDrinkBuyer canh trước cổng nhà bạn. Bất kể khi nào bạn có nhu cầu mua nước ngọt, bạn sẽ gọi nó. Bạn đâu có biết là thằng nhóc B đó nó chỉ biết mua nước ngọt ở Vinmart thôi. Bạn chỉ quan tâm là bạn gọi nó, và bạn có nước ngọt uống 4. RegisterNhư vậy, khai báo như thế nào trong ứng dụng của bạn? khi tạo mới một ứng dụng asp.net core 2, đã có sẵn 1 số phương thức giúp bạn bắt đầu ngay và luôn bằng cách thêm vào dòng code sau services.AddScoped(); bạn đã khai báo cho tất cả các class có dùng phương thức BuyDrink sẽ mua nước ngọt ở CircleK 4.1. LifetimeAddScoped dùng để chỉ định thời gian sống của service này, có 3 loại: Transient: mỗi lần gọi tới nó sẽ là 1 biến thể mới hoàn toàn. Cái này chỉ phù hợp cho các loại service siu nhẹ nhàng và ko có lưu trữ trạng thái Scoped: Trong cùng 1 request, nó sẽ chỉ được tạo 1 lần duy nhất Singleton: Nó sẽ được tạo lần đầu tiên khi được gọi, và sẽ sống quài cho tới khi app bạn chết 4.2. Contructor InjectionSau khi đã register service của bạn với 1 lifetime phù hợp, việc tiếp theo chính là tiêm - inject nó vào chỗ cần dùng (thường sẽ là controller) ASP.NET Core 2 hỗ trợ bạn inject service vào controller thông qua contructor của controller đó 4.3. Action InjectionĐôi khi bạn chỉ cần cái service này trong 1 action cụ thể nào đó của controller thôi, thì sẽ có cách hơi khác public IActionResult About([FromServices] IDrinkBuyer drinkBuyer) &#123; drinkBuyer.BuyDrink(&quot;coca&quot;); return View(); &#125; 4.4. Service trong ServiceNested services, service con, vân vân và mây mây Đôi khi bạn cần phải có 1 service con để service cha chạy được, thì inject như nào Rất đơn giản, cũng dùng contructor injection thôi Giả sử Service DrinkBuyer cần có service Trasport để chạy public interface ITransport &#123; void Transport(); &#125; public class BikeTransport: ITransport &#123; public void Transport() &#123; // transport by bike &#125; &#125; public class CarTransport: ITransport &#123; public void Transport() &#123; // transport by car &#125; &#125; đầu tiên đăng ký nó trong Startup.cs services.AddScoped(); sau đó bạn inject nó vào DrinkBuyer như sau public class CircleKDrinkBuyer: IDrinkBuyer &#123; private readonly ITransport _transport; public CircleKDrinkBuyer(ITransport transport) &#123; _transport = transport; &#125; public void BuyDrink(string name) &#123; // Go to circle k // Find the -name- drink // Buy it // Deliver _transport.Transport(); &#125; &#125; thế nà xong :D","categories":[{"name":"Design Pattern","slug":"Design-Pattern","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Design-Pattern/"}],"tags":[{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/ASP-NET/"},{"name":"dependency injection","slug":"dependency-injection","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/dependency-injection/"}]},{"title":"[ASPNET Core 2] – Middleware","slug":"aspnet-core-2-middleware","date":"2018-06-12T04:18:39.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/06/12/aspnet-core-2-middleware/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/06/12/aspnet-core-2-middleware/","excerpt":"For English version: [ASPNET Core 2] – Middleware Đôi khi bạn có một yêu cầu éo le: Viết Hello world bằng ASP.NET Dễ ẹt, dotnet new mvc, rồi sửa Views/Home/Index.cshtml cho nó trả về 1 dòng &lt;p&gt;hello world&lt;/p&gt; Thế là xong, phải ko?

Nước ở đầu ống (request) thì bẩn như kênh nhiêu lộc. Bạn mong muốn rằng nước ở cuối ống (response) phải sạch như nước khoáng Lavie. Chắc phải có lọc gì đó ở giữa ống nhể? Middleware chính là loại lọc đó. Nó gắn vào ứng dụng để xử lý requests và responses middleware có thể quyết định là nó có tiếp tục truyền cái request nó đã xử lý cho 1 middleware tiếp theo hay ko. Trong trường hợp nó ngắt luôn ko truyền, thì ta gọi đó là short-circuit 2. Các loại middleware Có 3 loại middleware, phân loại bằng cách bạn implement nó như nào Loại Có thể short-circuit Dùng để Use Có Short-circuit một requestLogic để tạo response Run Không Kết thúc pipeline MapMapWhen Không Phân nhánh pipeline dựa trên request pathMapWhen phân nhánh dựa trên điều kiệnHỗ trợ Nesting (multi-level branching) So sánh với đồ cổ ASP.NET MVC5 ASP.NET MVC5 ASP.NET Core 2 Khái niệm HTTP HandlersHTTP Modules middleware Lựa chọn?

Có nên tách ra thành nhiều project con? Có nên dùng package manager? Trong phần này, mình sẽ trình bày kinh nghiệm cá nhân về các tổ chức và quản lý projects, và dùng package manger nhóe 1. Project &amp; Solution 1.1. Lý do 1.1.1. Dùng lại 1.1.2. Phân phối 1.1.3. Triển khai 1.1.4. You name it 1.2. Phân chia projects 2. Package Manager 2.1. For backend - NUGET 2.2. For front-end - Yarn 2.2.1. Tính phụ thuộc 2.2.2. Sources 2.2.3. Tái tạo 1. Project &amp; SolutionCách dễ nhất, cũng như đơn giản nhất, là chỉ bao gồm 1 project mà thôi. Ở Part 1, bạn cũng đã có “kinh nghiệm” gõ lệnh tạo project. Visual Studio thì lại không như vậy, nó ép bạn phải xài một khái niệm gọi là “Solution”. Theo đó, một hoặc nhiều project sẽ nằm trong 1 solution. Khi bạn mở project được tạo bởi dòng lệnh dotnet new * trong Visual Studio, nó cũng sẽ tạo ra một cái Solution ất ơ nào đấy rồi nhét cái project của bạn vào. Sẽ là một thói quen tốt khi bạn tạo nhiều project ứng với các mục đích khác nhau, phục vụ cho dự án phần mềm của bạn nói chung và ASP.NET nói riêng 1.1. Lý doBạn thắc mắc là tại sao mình lại phải chia nhiều project như vậy? Để chung luôn thì có đỡ công include thư viện biết bao nhiêu không? 1.1.1. Dùng lạiKhi một số code có chức năng riêng biệt nào đó được bạn tách ra thành 1 project riêng, thì nó sẽ rất dễ dàng để dùng lại nó vào những dự án khác. Giả sử bạn có 1 số helpers và class giúp việc kết nối tới database rất nhanh chóng và gọn lẹ. Khi nó ở 1 project riêng, bạn có thể dễ dàng up nó lên git, rồi các project khác cứ thế mà clone về xài thôi. Khi bạn update project trên git đó, toàn bộ các clone của nó sẽ đều được update theo. 1.1.2. Phân phốiCũng ví dụ trên, project của bạn đã nằm ở mức library, tức là một thư viện rồi. Bạn có thể dụ bạn bè mình xài nó, phát triển thêm, đóng góp cho nó, pack nó lại thành nuget package, blah blah blah và blah blah blah 1.1.3. Triển khai1 công ty nọ thấy lib version 1.0 của bạn quá hay, họ quyết định tải zìa và xài trong dự án cực khủng của họ. 10 năm sau, bạn cập nhật cái lib của mình lên version 2.0, dùng lại toàn bộ các method và hàm sẵn có, chẳng qua là thay đổi thuật toán cho nó chạy nhanh lên thôi. Công ty chỉ cần bỏ ra 1 chi phí tối thiểu để clone cái lib của bạn về, build và replace cái lib đang chạy trên production của họ. Thế là xong. Không cần phải build lại cả project, không cần phải deploy lại. 1.1.4. You name itKhi bạn đã dấn thân vào nghiệp code càng lâu năm, bạn sẽ phát hiện ra càng nhiều lợi ích khác của việc chia tách này. 1.2. Phân chia projectsỞ mô hình MVC, cả Model-View-ViewModel đều gắn liền với nhau, nên chúng ta không tách Tuy nhiên, có một số công ty tách cái Model ra một project riêng. Điều này giúp bạn dễ quản lý code hơn. Đôi khi cũng tách luôn cái Controller thành 1 project 1 nguyên tắc mình hay dùng để tách project là dựa trên tính năng của nó. Ví dụ: Unit Test -&gt; Tách Data Connection Layer -&gt; Tách Encryption &#x2F; Decryption -&gt; Tách Encryption đứng riêng -&gt; KHÔNG tách 2. Package ManagerLàm web có 2 phần, front-end và back-end. Và cả 2 phần này đều có package manager (với ASP.NET) 2.1. For backend - NUGETVề phía backend, thì lợi ích của việc sử dụng package manager (nuget) là quá rõ ràng. Bạn chỉ cần “search &amp; install“, không còn cảnh đêm hôm khuya khoắt ngồi lọ mọ crack IDM để download một cái lib nào đấy có đuôi .dll, rồi mò mẫm trong đống file đã download để import nó vào project. Nó sẽ triệt tiêu luôn cái vấn đề tương thích platform với lib (lib build cho x64 chỉ chạy được trên x64 và tương tự cho x86) 2.2. For front-end - Yarn Bower đã bị ngừng hỗ trợ Về phía front-end thì sao? Chẳng phải chỉ cần thêm file .css và .js vào là web chạy ngon lành sao đúng rồi, NHƯNG nguồn không thống nhất lib này phụ thuộc lib kia, lib kia phụ thuộc lib nọ nó có chạy trên máy tui mà sao không chạy được trên máy khác và front-end package manager được tạo ra để giải quyết mấy vấn đề này Vậy đó, nếu ASP.NET chỉ có 1 (vài) package manager như Nuget, thì trong thế giới front-emd ta có cả chục. Mình sẽ giới thiệu sơ qua về 1 tân binh mới nổi, và đang rất hot - YARN 2.2.1. Tính phụ thuộcJQuery là một lib rất phổ biến, và ty tỷ lib khác được xây dựng mà cần tới nó. Nhưng JQuery có cũng kha khá phiên bản khác nhau, và các lib khác nhau lại dùng các version khác nhau của JQuery. Yarn sẽ giúp bạn loại bỏ vấn đề này. Khi JQuery được cài đặt qua Yarn, sẽ chỉ có 1 version duy nhất, và tất cả package khác đều sẽ dựa trên version này. 2.2.2. SourcesToàn bộ package được host trên yarn, thì bạn chỉ cần lên Yarn lấy về là xong, không cần phải vào từng website của từng lib, rồi kiếm cái nút download nữa. 2.2.3. Tái tạoYarn sử dụng một file package.json để lưu trữ thông tin các package đã được cài đặt. Dùng file này, trên bất kỳ máy nào, nó sẽ tạo ra chính xác các file cần thiết để project của bạn có thể chạy ngon lành y như lúc dev vậy Thế nhé bạn ;)","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"project","slug":"project","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/project/"},{"name":"structure","slug":"structure","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/structure/"},{"name":"architech","slug":"architech","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/architech/"},{"name":"manager","slug":"manager","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/manager/"},{"name":"package","slug":"package","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/package/"}]},{"title":"[ASP.NET for Beginner] - Part 4 - CRUD và Data Validation","slug":"aspnet-for-beginner-part-4-crud-va-data-validation","date":"2018-03-25T10:03:16.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.568Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/25/aspnet-for-beginner-part-4-crud-va-data-validation/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/03/25/aspnet-for-beginner-part-4-crud-va-data-validation/","excerpt":"Vậy là bạn đã có một khái niệm cơ bản về MVC, cách kết nối tới database, lựa chọn cho mình một front end phù hợp, đã tới lúc bắt tay vào thực hiện 4 thao tác cơ bản nhất của bất kỳ ứng dụng web nào: CRUD","text":"Vậy là bạn đã có một khái niệm cơ bản về MVC, cách kết nối tới database, lựa chọn cho mình một front end phù hợp, đã tới lúc bắt tay vào thực hiện 4 thao tác cơ bản nhất của bất kỳ ứng dụng web nào: CRUD Xem các bài viết trong series Phần 1: Mô hình MVC Phần 2: Connect Database và Model Binding Phần 3: Front end framework nào Phần 4: CRUD và Data Validation 1. CRUD 1.1. DbContext 1.2. Create 1.3. Read 1.4. Update 1.4.1. The Simplest - 2 trip to database 1.4.2. A more complicated 1.4.3. Track??? 1.5. Delete 2. DbContext - Một cách code tốt hơn 2.1. Nếu CRUD failed? 2.2. await hay không? 3. Model Validation 3.1. DataAnnotation 3.2. Client side validation 1. CRUD CRUD viết tắt cho 4 hành động liên quan tới database là Create, Read, Update và Delete Bài viết này giả định rằng bạn sử dụng Entity Framework, như đã nói ở phần 2, và đã có sẵn code trong ví dụ Bạn có thể clone code tại Github ở đây 1.1. DbContext Trong ví dụ mvcbasic, MvcBasicDbContext đã được tạo sẵn cho bạn, và được khai báo ở mỗi Controller cần thiết. Ta sẽ sử dụng class này Trong class PhoneController đã được tạo sẵn trong ví dụ, bạn có thể thấy cả 4 phương thức này được viết sẵn. 1.2. Create Để tạo 1 record trong database, đối với Entity Framework, chuyện rất đơn giản var phone = new Phone &#123; Name = &quot;Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017)&quot; &#125;; _context.Phones.Add(phone); _context.SaveChanges(); Trong trường hợp bạn muốn thêm nhiều dòng cùng một lúc, thì Entity Framework hỗ trợ một phương thức khác var phones = new List&lt;Phone&gt;(); var phone = new Phone &#123; Name = &quot;Phone 1&quot; &#125;; phones.Add(phone); phone = new Phone &#123; Name = &quot;Phone 2&quot; &#125;; phones.Add(phone); _context.Phones.AddRange(phones); _context.SaveChanges(); 1.3. Read Để lấy 1 dòng dữ liệu từ 1 bảng, bạn có thể dùng method Find var id = 1; var phone = _context.Phones.Find(id); Method Find sẽ tìm trong bảng Phone có khóa chính &#x3D; id của bạn. Kết quả trả về null nếu khóa đó không tồn tại Để lấy nhiều dòng dữ liệu thỏa một điều kiện nào đó, bạn có thể dùng LINQ để query var searchKey = &quot;samsung&quot;; var phones = _context.Phones.Where(x =&gt; x.Name.Contains(searchKey)); x đại diện cho 1 object Phone trong database x.Name.Contains(searchKey) nghĩa là Name có chứa string searchKey Hầu như tất cả các query bạn quen thuộc khi viết câu truy vấn bằng SQL đều có thể viết được dưới dạng LINQ. Đây gọi là LINQ to Entities (Dùng Linq để query thông qua các entities trong Entity Framework) Bạn có thể tìm các câu lệnh tương ứng trong Linq bằng từ khóa: “How to hành động bạn muốn làm using linq” Kết quả trả về của một truy vấn là kiểu dữ liệu IQueryable. Bạn có thể tiếp tục lọc, gom nhóm, filter lại, hoặc chuyển đổi thành một kiểu dữ liệu khác như List, Array, etc Bạn có thể xem thêm về các câu lệnh Linq được support ở đây: Supported and Unsupported LINQ Methods (LINQ to Entities) on docs.microsoft.com 1.4. Update Không đơn giản như các lệnh khác, update dùng Entity Framework hơi phức tạp (hơi thôi) 1.4.1. The Simplest - 2 trip to database Cách đơn giản nhất để update 1 record gồm 3 bước 1. Lấy record đó lên từ database - Truy cập database lần 1 2. Thay đổi 1 thông tin nào đó trong record 3. Update lại record đó trong database - Truy cập database lần 2 code của nó như sau // get the phone object from database var phone = _context.Phones.Find(phoneId); // change some info phone.Name = &quot;Test&quot; // update the change to database _context.SaveChanges(); Như bạn thấy, cách này bắt buộc bạn phải lấy 1 dữ liệu từ database lên trước khi bạn có thể edit nó 1.4.2. A more complicated Vậy nếu bạn biết trước tất cả các dữ liệu của object thì sao? Trong trường hợp này, query record đó từ database là không cần thiết // Create the object from your brain var phone = new Phone &#123; Id = 1 &#125;; // Attach it to DbContext, so the DbContext can &quot;track&quot; the object // Gắn nó vào DbContext, để DbContext có thể &quot;theo dõi&quot; object của bạn _context.Phones.Attach(phone); // Do some change phone.Name = &quot;Test&quot;; // Save the change _context.SaveChanges(); 1.4.3. Track??? Entity Framework có 1 cách rất hay (và hơi phức tạp) để có thể tối ưu hóa các phương thức truy xuất&#x2F;cập nhật dữ liệu: Nó sẽ theo dõi các thay đổi của 1 object Giả sử, object của bạn có 50 field. Bạn chỉ thay đổi 1 field trong đó, rồi gọi _context.SaveChanges(), EF sẽ biết được rằng chỉ có 1 field bị thay đổi, và nó sẽ cập nhật đúng 1 field duy nhất, tăng hiệu suất của ứng dụng. Để làm được điều này, nó sẽ query object đó trước bằng khóa chính, và khi bạn gọi Attach, nó sẽ bắt đầu theo dõi object của bạn. Khi bạn thay đổi 1 field, thì trạng thái của field đó từ Unmodified sẽ chuyển thành Modified 1.5. Delete Tương tự như edit, khi muốn delete 1 object, bạn cũng cần “2 chuyến” tới database var phone = _context.Phones.Find(id); _context.Phones.Remove(phone); _context.SaveChanges(); 2. DbContext - Một cách code tốt hơn 2.1. Nếu CRUD failed? Sẽ có nhiều trường hợp, khi gọi các câu lệnh crud bằng entity framework, ko có dòng data nào được thêm vào hoặc sửa đổi. Vậy làm sao bạn biết khi nào thành công khi nào không? _context.SaveChanges(); May mắn là method trên trả về số lượng record có thay đổi Vì vậy, bạn có thể kiểm tra rất dễ bằng cách // your code here to CRUD var result = _context.SaveChanges(); bằng cách kiểm tra “result &gt; 0”, bạn có thể biết được câu lệnh save changes của mình có thành công hay ko 2.2. await hay không? Trong code controller được sinh ra bởi asp.net, bạn sẽ thấy các câu lệnh có dùng _context đều có async đằng sau, đằng trước là await, và kiểu dữ liệu của method là Task Hiểu một cách đơn giản, async - await là một cặp từ khóa giúp đơn giản hóa việc lập trình multi thread. Nếu bạn chưa nắm vững kỹ thuật async-await, thì mình khuyên bạn là nên… bỏ hẳn và chỉ sử dụng các method trong các phần code bên trên trong bài viết này 3. Model Validation Chắc hẳn bạn đã từng nghe các ràng buộc như Tên không được chứa quá 20 ký tự Số điện thoại phải có 10 số Bạn có tự hỏi “Họ đã làm điều đó như thế nào?” 3.1. DataAnnotation ASP.NET cho phép bạn ràng buộc dữ liệu thông qua các DataAnnotation được viết thêm trên đầu mỗi property Lấy ví dụ với model Phone, mình muốn thêm 1 ràng buộc là tên không được quá 50 ký tự, và báo lỗi khi user nhập quá số lượng namespace mvcbasic.Models &#123; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; public class Phone &#123; public int Id &#123; get; set; &#125; [StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = &quot;Name cannot be more than 50 characters&quot;)] public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; &#125; Bạn có thể tìm hiểu sâu hơn về cách làm 1 câu error message chung cho tất cả các property cùng loại tại đây: Error Message – chung mà riêng Để check một object có thỏa điều kiện của model ko, bạn có thể dùng ModelState. Ví dụ trong method Create // POST: Phone/Create // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598. [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Create([Bind(&quot;Id,Name&quot;)] Phone phone) &#123; // CHECK MODEL STATE HERE if (ModelState.IsValid) &#123; _context.Add(phone); await _context.SaveChangesAsync(); var phone2 = new Phone &#123; Name = &quot;Test&quot; &#125;; var phones = new List&lt;Phone&gt;(); _context.Phones.AddRange(phones); return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index)); &#125; return View(phone); &#125; 3.2. Client side validation Client side validation cho phép user thấy các lỗi dữ liệu ngay khi họ nhập mà chưa cần gửi data lên server của bạn Việc bạn cần làm là thêm các dòng sau vào code View của mình &lt;!--dòng này có thể đã nằm trong file View/Shared/_Layout.cshtml của bạn rồi--&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-2.2.0.min.js&quot;&gt;https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-2.2.0.min.js&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.16.0/jquery.validate.min.js&quot;&gt;https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.16.0/jquery.validate.min.js&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validation.unobtrusive/3.2.6/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js&quot;&gt;https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validation.unobtrusive/3.2.6/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js&lt;/a&gt; và trong form, bạn thêm đoạn code sau để hiển thị thông báo lỗi (nếu có) &lt;form asp-action=&quot;Create&quot;&gt; &lt;!--dòng này hiển thị một thông báo tổng hợp tất cả các lỗi--&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;text-danger&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt; &lt;!--dòng này hiển thị thông báo lỗi cụ thể cho form--&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;text-danger&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; Lỗi hiển thị như sau Bạn có thể xem toàn bộ các annotation ở đây: Data Annotation on docs.microsoft.com Thế là xong.

Cái nào là tốt nhất? Một ứng dụng web được chia thành 2 thành phần chính là Front-end và Back-end. Về phía back end, có hàng ty tỷ ngôn ngữ và công nghệ có thể làm nên chúng. ASP.NET là một trong các công nghệ đó. Và tất cả các công nghệ &#x2F; ngôn ngữ này đều phục vụ một mục đích tối thượng: Tạo ra front end Trong một diễn biến khác, Front end chỉ có 1, được cấu thành từ 3 ngôn ngữ là HTML, CSS và Javascript Nếu bạn chưa biết cơ bản về HTML, Javascript và CSS, thì hãy học ngay Học HTML Học CSS Học Javascript 3 ngôn ngữ này, theo ý kiến chủ quan của mình, như mì ăn liền. Cách tổ chức khá lộn xộn, và quy chuẩn thì được áp dụng khác nhau đối với các trình duyệt khác nhau Quy chuẩn của HTML HTML có 1 bộ quy chuẩn giúp cho các nhà phát triển trình duyệt biết được chính xác phải làm gì khi hiển thị các thẻ của HTML trên trình duyệt Để làm cho cuộc đời bớt đau khổ, các developer trên khắp thế giới đã cùng nhau phát triển thêm những framework, những ngôn ngữ hỗ trợ thêm cho bộ 3 này 1. CSS 1.1. CSS Framework Làm sao để chia web thành các cột linh hoạt? Làm sao để khi kích thước trình duyệt thay đổi, trang web sẽ hiển thị các thành phần phù hợp? Làm sao để trang web có thể đọc được trên điện thoại di động? Hàng tá các câu hỏi như vậy sẽ nảy ra trong đầu bạn khi bạn đang phát triển một website nào đó. Để giải quyết vấn đề đó, ta có các CSS Frameworks làm sẵn giúp bạn các công việc này, bạn chỉ cần áp dụng. 1.1.1. Bootstrap Bootstrap có lẽ là css framework được sử dụng nhiều nhất hiện nay với bộ plugin đồ sộ + kho tàng theme thủng cực khủng của mình Bootstrap sử dụng 1 khái niệm gọi là responsive breakdown, tức là khi bề ngang trình duyệt đạt tới 1 số lượng pixels nào đó, thì một số thành phần HTML sẽ bị ẩn đi hoặc hiện ra. Nhược điểm Quá phổ biến: Điều này tuy giúp ích trong quá trình phát triển, nhưng sẽ làm cho website của bạn nó…na ná với cả triệu website khác Grid system dùng concrete class: Đối với mỗi size khác nhau, bạn sẽ phải thêm các class khác nhau của mỗi column vào thẻ html Nặng: Bootstrap cần 1 file css, 1 file javascript, và cả cái thư viện jQuery + poper.js. Nếu website của bạn ko dùng jQuery? Thôi nghỉ chơi với boostrap nhé 1.1.2. MaterializeCSS Nếu bạn có đang dùng các sản phẩm của google, thì bạn sẽ thấy họ có 1 style khá đẹp, nhất là khi nhấn vào 1 cái nút nào đó, sẽ có 1 vòng tròn tỏa ra. Cái này được gọi là Material Design Materializecss làm theo cái design này, và open source nó cho mọi người sử dụng. Nhanh, nhẹ, đẹp, hỗ trợ tốt, cộng đồng lớn là những ưu điểm của framework này Nhược điểm Quá Google: website của bạn khi dùng framework này, nó sẽ cho người dùng 1 cảm giác hơi…google. Từ cái nút bấm cho tới cái ô grid Chưa release: Tin hay ko thì tùy bạn, dù có hằng hà sa số website đang dùng, với gần 32k stars trên Github, nhưng framework này vẫn chưa được release version 1.0. Các nhà phát triển nó đang rất gấp rút fix bug và hoàn thiện để ra mắt phiên bản release đầu tiên của nó ;) 1.1.3. Các Grid System Cái quan trọng nhất của một framework là grid system, tức là cách chia website thành các column khác nhau. Nắm bắt được điều này, kha khá framework ra đời, và chỉ chứa độc nhất 1 tính năng: chia column. Nhược điểm Nhìn chung, khi sử dụng các framework dạng này, bạn sẽ phải khá chuyên nghiệp rồi. Khi đó bạn sẽ phải tự code các thành phần css khác ko liên quan tới grid, hoặc tìm các thư viện hỗ trợ cho những thành phần mong muốn 1.2. CSS Language Preprocessor Ngôn ngữ css, với một cách tổ chức tè le, là một thử thách khá khó khăn cho developer mới học. May mắn thay, đã có những ngôn ngữ thay thế cho nó Thay thế cũng không hẳn là đúng. Các ngôn ngữ này chỉ giúp bạn viết code css dễ hiểu hơn, khoa học hơn, tổ chức tốt hơn. Sau cùng, nó vẫn generate ra file .css cho bạn sử dụng. 1.2.1. SCSS SCSS kế thừa và cải tiến CSS selector bằng các cấu trúc &#123;&#125;, :và &amp;gt;. Khi bạn bắt tay vào học nó, bạn sẽ thấy cách select một element vô cùng tự nhiên của nó 1.2.2. LESS Less giống như một phiên bản khác của Scss vậy, với cú pháp cũng khá giống nhau, các khái niệm cũng giống luôn. Bạn chỉ nên chọn 1, hoặc SCSS, hoặc LESS 2. Javascript Ngôn ngữ HTML, vốn dĩ chỉ là các đoạn text có thêm markup và link, chỉ có thể cho phép bạn đọc text và nhấn link để nhảy sang 1 trang khác mà thôi. Mọi chuyện thay đổi khi javascript được gắn thêm vào. Giờ đây bạn có thể thay đổi 1 khúc text mà ko cần reload, làm cho biểu tượng này xoay xoay, làm cho nút kia chuyển động, hiển thị popup, vân vân và vân vân. Javascript không hề dính dáng gì tới Java cả 2.1. jQuery jQuery giống như 1 thư viện “phải có” vậy. Nó giúp cho việc sử dụng cả tá css framework khác trở nên đơn giản và hiệu quả. Ví dụ: Để đổi đoạn value của thẻ input có id là “test” thành chữ khác // Before jquery document.getElementById(&quot;test&quot;).value = &quot;Test Value&quot;; // After jquery $(&quot;#test&quot;).val(&quot;Test Value&quot;); Vì sử dụng các khái niệm của CSS Selector, bạn có thể chọn các html element bằng jQuery y như khi bạn code css cho nó vậy. 2.2. Xu hướng vì jQuery khá nặng, việc xử lý jQuery cũng đòi hỏi một phần tài nguyên của trình duyện, nên hiện đang có 1 xu hướng là bỏ hẳn jQuery ko xài nó nữa. Nhưng từ giờ tới lúc jQuery biến mất vẫn còn xa lắm. Máy tính và điện thoại thì ngày càng mạnh mẽ hơn. jQuery hầu như đã được tải sẵn trên bất cứ trình duyệt nào bạn tìm thấy 3. HTML HTML5, như đã nói ở trên, là version mới nhất của HTML, và tất cả các trình duyệt phổ biến hỗ trợ. Nếu bạn code bằng Visual Studio, thì HTML đã được hỗ trợ khá tốt rồi. Còn nếu bạn code bằng Visual Studio Code, thì sau đây là 1 số extension mình sử dụng để việc code HTML được dễ thở hơn Auto Close Tag: tự đóng các thẻ HTML. Không cần phải gõ tay nữa HTML Snippets: tự nhắc các property của 1 thẻ HTML Cái nào là tốt nhất? Không có câu trả lời cụ thể cho câu hỏi này, nên mình sẽ đưa ý kiến của mình, và cái mình đang sử dụng để bạn tham khảo CSS: SCSS CSS Framework: Materializecss Javascript: jQuery HTML: HTML5 Còn bạn, bạn chọn ngôn ngữ nào?","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"css","slug":"css","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/css/"},{"name":"framework","slug":"framework","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/framework/"},{"name":"frontend","slug":"frontend","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/frontend/"},{"name":"jquery","slug":"jquery","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/jquery/"},{"name":"scss","slug":"scss","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/scss/"}]},{"title":"[ASP.NET for Beginner] - Part 2 - Connect Database and Model Binding","slug":"asp-net-for-beginner-part-2-connect-database-and-model-binding","date":"2018-03-11T16:11:47.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/11/asp-net-for-beginner-part-2-connect-database-and-model-binding/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/03/11/asp-net-for-beginner-part-2-connect-database-and-model-binding/","excerpt":"Ở phần trước bạn đã có một khái niệm cơ bản về mô hình MVC.

Tạo Migration đầu tiên 4. Model Binding 4.1. Tạo Controller 4.2. Các nuget cần thiết 4.3. Scaffolding 5. Model Binding Có thể hiểu database là trái tim của ứng dụng, còn asp.net là bộ não. Thiết kế một database cho đúng chuẩn thì đòi hỏi kha khá thời gian học + luyện tập thì nó mới lên trình được. Một cách khác rất hay là bắt tay vào làm một project thực tế. Nếu làm theo phần trước, chắc bạn cũng đã có 1 sample project với tên mvcbasic nhỉ. Nhìn chung, bạn sẽ có 1 project giống như sau: MVC Basic 0.1 on Github 1. Lựa chọn database Có hơi bị nhiều hệ quản trị cơ sở dữ liệu đang đấu đá nhau trên thị trường. Ở đây mình sẽ nói sơ qua 1 số loại phổ biến 1.1. SQL Server Cây nhà là vườn, miễn phí cho người dùng cá nhân, hiệu suất cao, mạnh mẽ, là hệ cơ sở dữ liệu có quan hệ. Sql Server đã chứng minh cho mọi dev thấy tính ổn định của nó. 1.2. The others Nhìn chung, Microsoft có hỗ trợ kha khá các hệ cơ sở dữ liệu khác như MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, nhưng nếu đã lựa chọn các hệ này, thì bạn sẽ phải tự mày mò kha khá các vấn đề mà đa phần đã được giải quyết khi dùng SQL Server 2. Entity Framework ASP.NET có một điểm mạnh là Entity Framework (EF). Ở phiên bản core thì nó có thêm EF Core. EF hiểu nôm na là một bộ công cụ cho phép bạn kết nối tới database, truy vấn, thêm xóa sửa vân vân mà không cần phải có kiến thức về cách viết SQL. Có lợi thì cũng phải có hại, EF theo đánh giá của nhiều người thì nó khá….chậm. Điều này đã và đang được cải thiện rất nhiều ở phiên bản mới đi kèm với ASP.NET Core là Entity Framework Core. Bạn cần cài đặt SQL Server Express SQL Server Management Studio (optional) Cài nuget package Mở project mvcbasic bằng vscode Lần lượt gõ các lệnh sau trong terminal dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design Sau đó, mở file mvcbasic.csproj và thêm dòng sau &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;DotNetCliToolReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.0&quot; /&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt; tiếp tục gõ trong terminal dotnet restore 3. Tạo Model và Database Có 2 cách để bắt đầu làm việc với database trong asp.net core là Code first và Database first. Ngắn gọn thì Code first cho phép bạn viết code trước (tạo các model class), rồi các model bạn tạo sẽ được cập nhật lên database thông qua các migration. Database first thì là cách truyền thống từ xưa tới nay: Tạo database trước, và code của bạn có nghĩa vụ ‘connect’ tới database đó. Bạn có thể tham khảo thêm ở đây: Code first vs Database first 3.1. Tạo model Phone chuột phải vào folder Models &gt; new file &gt; Phone.cs namespace mvcbasic.Models &#123; public class Phone &#123; public int Id &#123; get; set; &#125; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; &#125; 3.2. Tạo Database Context Database Context có thể hiểu như một công cụ cho phép ứng dụng của bạn kết nối tới Database và thực hiện các tác vụ thêm xóa sửa. Tạo 1 folder mới ở thư mục gốc với tên ‘Data’ Chuột phải vào folder Data &gt; new file &gt; MvcBasicDbContext.cs namespace mvcbasic.Data &#123; using Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; public class MvcBasicDbContext : DbContext &#123; public MvcBasicDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;MvcBasicDbContext&gt; options) : base(options) &#123; &#125; public DbSet&lt;Phone&gt; Phones &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; &#125; 3.3. Cài đặt Connection String Để kết nối tới database, thì Entity Framework sẽ cần có các thông tin như username, password, tên database, server đang host cái database này. Tất cả thông số đó đều gộp chung lại thành 1 đoạn string, và giang hồ gọi nó là connection string Mở file appsettings.json và thêm vào đoạn json sau &quot;ConnectionStrings&quot; : &#123; &quot;PhoneDbConnectionString&quot;: &quot;Server=(localdb)\\\\\\\\mssqllocaldb;Database=PhoneDb;Trusted\\_Connection=True;&quot; &#125; Đoạn connection string trên có ý nghĩa như sau Server: LocalDb (là một dạng database local có trên các phiên bản mới của SQL Server) Database: PhoneDb Connection tới database dùng Windows Authentication Bạn có thể sẽ phải config lại đoạn connection string này cho đúng với môi trường làm việc của bạn 3.4. Cài đặt kết nối Mở file Startup.cs, tìm method ConfigureServices và thêm vào dòng sau services.AddDbContext&lt;MvcBasicDbContext&gt;(options =&gt; options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString(&quot;PhoneDbConnectionString&quot;))); và nhớ add thêm 2 dòng using using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using mvcbasic.Data; 3.5. Tạo Migration đầu tiên Sau khi tất cả các thao tác chuẩn bị đã hoàn tất, đã tới lúc bạn tạo migration đầu tiên của mình Trong terminal, gõ dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate VSCode sẽ tự động tạo ra một thư mục tên Migrations, và thêm cơ số file vào đấy new files Tiếp tục, gõ dotnet ef database update thì những migration này sẽ được thực thi, và database sẽ được tạo ra Để kiểm tra, bạn có thể dùng Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio với các thông số sau Server Name: (LocalDb)\\MSSQLLocalDB Authentication: Windows Authentication MSSQLLocalDB là tên instance của bạn, có thể khác nếu khi cài SQL Server bạn ko chọn như default 4. Model Binding Sau khi hoàn tất các bước trên, cơ bản web app của bạn đã có thể kết nối tới database. Nhưng để thực hiện các hành động thêm xóa sửa, thì bạn cần phải có Controller nữa Bạn có thể tải project hoàn tất ở bước 3 tại đây 4.1. Tạo Controller VSCode cũng hỗ trợ bạn trong việc tự động tạo ra controller mong muốn mà ko phải code nhiều (thực ra ko phải là VSCode hỗ trợ, mà một công cụ gọi là .NET Cli tools và vài nuget package cho phép bạn làm chuyện này, nhưng trước mắt cứ hiểu vậy đã) Tên Controller, theo asp.net convention như mình đã nói ở phần 1, sẽ có dạng [Tên]Controller, trong trường hợp này sẽ là PhoneController. Một quy tắc đặt tên phổ biến là Tên bảng -&gt; số nhiều: Phones Tên model -&gt; số ít: Phone Tên controller: PhoneController Tên view: Create, Delete, Details, Edit và Index 4.2. Các nuget cần thiết Để có thể tạo controller, bạn sẽ cần thêm một số tool nữa Mở mvcbasic.csproj và thêm các dòng sau ... &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.2&quot; /&gt; ... &lt;DotNetCliToolReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.2&quot; /&gt; ... Tổng quan, file csproj sẽ giống như sau &lt;Project Sdk=&quot;Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web&quot;&gt; &lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netcoreapp2.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore.All&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.5&quot; /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.1&quot; /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design&quot; Version=&quot;1.1.5&quot; /&gt; &lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.2&quot; /&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt; &lt;ItemGroup&gt; &lt;DotNetCliToolReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.1&quot; /&gt; &lt;DotNetCliToolReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools&quot; Version=&quot;2.0.2&quot; /&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt; &lt;/Project&gt; 4.3. Scaffolding Mở terminal, và gõ lệnh sau dotnet restore dotnet build dotnet aspnet-codegenerator controller -name PhoneController -m Phone -dc MvcBasicDbContext --relativeFolderPath Controllers --useDefaultLayout --referenceScriptLibraries Nhìn vào câu lệnh trên, chắc bạn cũng sẽ đoán được nó làm gì: “Này dotnet, tạo cho tao 1 controller mới tên là PhoneController, dùng model là Phone, Data Context là MvcBasicDbContext, trong folder tên là Controllers, dùng default layout, à có scripts đi kèm nhá” 2 câu lệnh đầu tiên giúp bạn thực sự cài nuget, và build project một phát để đảm bảo ko có lỗi phát sinh, và clear các file tạm ko còn cần thiết gõ tiếp dotnet run để chạy thử app bạn có thể vọc vạch các kiểu với các link mà asp.net core tạo sẵn cho bạn, create new, edit, delete, details gì đấy thì tùy 5. Model Binding Mở file PhoneController ra, bạn sẽ thấy có sẵn code trong đấy rồi, tuy ko đẹp lắm, nhưng nhìn chung là nó chạy tốt Hãy nhìn vào method Details // GET: Phone/Details/5 public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Details(int? id) &#123; if (id == null) &#123; return NotFound(); &#125; var phone = await _context.Phones .SingleOrDefaultAsync(m =&gt; m.Id == id); if (phone == null) &#123; return NotFound(); &#125; return View(phone); &#125; Method này nhận một tham số là nullable int có tên là id, khi bạn gọi tới url Phone&#x2F;Details&#x2F;5 (như dòng comment ở bên trên), thì số 5 đó sẽ được hiểu là Id. Đó chính là model binding Tiếp tục, nhìn vào class Create có attribute [HttpPost] // POST: Phone/Create // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598. [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Create([Bind(&quot;Id,Name&quot;)] Phone phone) &#123; if (ModelState.IsValid) &#123; _context.Add(phone); await _context.SaveChangesAsync(); return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index)); &#125; return View(phone); &#125; Model binding còn vi diệu ở chỗ, nếu bạn dùng hẳn 1 class làm parameter, thì ASP.NET sẽ tự hiểu các property trong class đó, và gắn đúng từng giá trị một Bạn có thể xóa [Bind(&quot;Id,Name&quot;)] đi và code vẫn chạy tốt, nhưng như Microsoft đã cảnh báo, để bảo vệ bạn khỏi chuyện orver posting attack, thì bạn phải chỉ định luôn là property nào sẽ được gắn Method này tương ứng với Views &gt; Phone &gt; Create.cshtml &lt;!--dòng 17--&gt; &lt;input asp-for=&quot;Name&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; /&gt; từ khóa asp-for thông báo rằng Name là property sẽ được truyền lên server, và server sẽ “gắn” nó vào model phone của method Create Tại sao lại ko có Id? Vì Id mặc định được coi như Key của bảng Phone, và key thì ko cần phải có khi tạo mới, vì database sẽ tự sinh ra nó Tiếp tục, mở Views &gt; Phone &gt; Index.cshtml bạn sẽ thấy đoạn code sau @foreach (var item in Model) &#123; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.Name) &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;a asp-action=&quot;Edit&quot; asp-route-id=&quot;@item.Id&quot;&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a asp-action=&quot;Details&quot; asp-route-id=&quot;@item.Id&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a asp-action=&quot;Delete&quot; asp-route-id=&quot;@item.Id&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &#125; ô lạ chưa, có foreach trong html Ngôn ngữ này gọi là Razor, cho phép bạn thực thi một số đoạn code C# trong html, giúp cho việc render ra các tag html như mong muốn. Razor thông minh tới mức nó tự hiểu chỗ nào là code html, và chỗ nào là code Razor, với các nguyên tắc vô cùng đơn giản Mỗi đoạn code razor đều bắt đầu bằng dấu @ Ngay sau dấu &#123; hoặc ( thì ko cần @ Database và Model binding còn nhiều điều để nói.

Bài viết này đưa ra một số khái niệm cơ bản, và cách áp dụng chúng trong code thực tế. Xem các bài viết trong series Phần 1: Mô hình MVC Phần 2: Connect Database và Model Binding Phần 3: Front end framework nào Phần 4: CRUD và Data Validation 1. MVC là gì? 1.1. Model 1.2. View 1.3. Controller 2. Một ví dụ đơn giản 2.1. Bài toán 2.2. Phân tích 2.3. Triển khai 2.3.1. Tính năng xem danh sách 2.3.2. Tính năng thêm 3. Tự tạo project 3.1. Phần mềm cần thiết 3.2. Triển 3.3. ASP.NET Convention 1. MVC là gì? MVC là một kiến trúc phần mềm dùng để phát triển kha khá ứng dụng bạn đang dùng trên thị trường. Mô hình MVC bóc tách 3 tầng của ứng dụng thành 3 thành phần khác nhau, giúp việc phát triển dễ dàng hơn. MVC là viết tắt của Model-View-Controller 3 thành phần này phải đi kèm với nhau, nhưng đối với người mới học, sẽ rất khó để hình dung ra chúng liên kết như thế nào. Học bất kỳ thành phần nào trước đều khó khăn khi không hiểu 2 thành phần kia. Vì vậy mình khuyên các bạn chỉ cần hình dung mỗi thành phần ra trong đầu, chứ đừng bắt tay ngay vào việc tìm hiểu liên kết giữa chúng. 1.1. Model Model là cách mà bạn thể hiện data trong code của mình. Giả sử trong cơ sở dữ liệu của bạn có table Users, mỗi user đều có tên tuổi địa chỉ, thì model của bạn sẽ là // A basic model public class User &#123; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; public int Age &#123; get; set; &#125; public string Address &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; 1.2. View View chỉ đóng 1 vai trò duy nhất: Render ra giao diện cho người dùng. Textbox (ô để điền text), dropdown list (chọn giá trị từ 1 danh sách), checkbox (ô chọn có&#x2F;không) là những thứ thường thấy trên View. Ví dụ, để hiển thị 1 user ra màn hình, thì code asp.net như sau @model User &lt;div&gt; @Model.Name @Model.Age @Model.Address &lt;/div&gt; 1.3. Controller Controller là thứ quyết định View nào sẽ được hiển thị khi user nhập một URL. Nó cũng sẽ là thứ nhận data từ user khi họ điền một form, click một nút, vân vân và vân vân 2. Một ví dụ đơn giản Vì ví dụ này được đưa ra để bạn hiểu mô hình MVC, nên bạn ko cần phải làm theo. Chỉ cần đọc tiếp thôi 2.1. Bài toán Thế giới di động cần 1 cái website có thể hiện thị danh sách các điện thoại, thêm&#x2F;xóa&#x2F;sửa một điện thoại nào đó (bỏ qua tất cả các yêu cầu về bảo mật, đăng nhập, giao diện) 2.2. Phân tích Đọc vào thấy ngay, ta cần một model cho điện thoại, 4 view cho 4 cái tính năng là xem danh sách, thêm, xóa, sửa. Vì cả 4 view này đều thao tác trên cái model điện thoại, nên ta chỉ cần 1 controller mà thôi 2.3. Triển khai 2.3.1. Tính năng xem danh sách Model public class MobilePhone &#123; // To identify which phones // Dùng để xác định cái điện thoại nào public int Id &#123; get; set; &#125; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; Controller public class MobilePhoneController &#123; public void List() &#123; // Get all phones from database var allPhones = database.MobilePhones; // Return the View that render a list of phones return View(allPhones) &#125; &#125; View @model List&lt;MobilePhone&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;!--Table headers--&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;td&gt;Id&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/th&gt; &lt;!--Table body--&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; @foreach(var phone in Model) &#123; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;@phone.Id&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;@phone.Name&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &#125; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ASP.NET tự động hiểu class MobilePhoneController sẽ có đường dẫn là /MobilePhone Khi người dùng trỏ tới URL sau: yourdomain/MobilePhone/List thì bằng một cách thần kỳ nào đó, asp.net đã gọi method List trong controller này, và chạy những đoạn code trong đó, trả về một cái bảng danh sách các điện thoại hiển thị lên cho người dùng 2.3.2. Tính năng thêm Dùng lại model cũ, ta chỉ cần thêm code cho View và Controller Controller public class MobilePhoneController &#123; public void List() &#123; // Get all phones from database // Lấy tất cả điện thoại từ database var allPhones = database.MobilePhones; // Return the View that render a list of phones // Trả về view chứa thông tin tất cả điện thoại return View(allPhones) &#125; // Render the Add form // Hiển thị cái form Add public void Add() &#123; return View(); &#125; // Recieved the new phone input by user // Nhận data được nhập vào từ người dùng [HttpPost] public void Add(MobilePhone newPhone) &#123; var existedPhone = database.MobilePhones.Find(newPhone.Id) if(existedPhone != null) &#123; // Phone is existed, return the Add View // Điện thoại với Id này đã tồn tại, trả về cái view Add return View(newPhone); &#125; // Add new data to database database.MobilePhones.Add(newPhone); // Save the changes database.SaveChanges(); &#125; &#125; Tại sao lại có 2 method Add? Ở method đầu tiên, ASP.NET sẽ trả về cái form rỗng cho người dùng tự nhập vào giá trị. Method thứ 2 có chứa parameter là newPhone. Method có trách nhiệm nhận thông tin được post lên từ phía người dùng. ASP.NET đủ thông minh để có thể tự hiểu nó là object kiểu MobilePhone, và nó gọi là Model Binding. Ta sẽ tìm hiểu về chủ đề này sau. View thêm file Add.cshtml Đối với ASP.NET Core @model MobilePhone &lt;form asp-action=&quot;Add&quot; asp-controller=&quot;MobilePhone&quot;&gt; &lt;label&gt;Id&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input asp-for=&quot;Id&quot;/&gt; &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input asp-for=&quot;Name&quot;/&gt; &lt;/form&gt; Đối với ASP.NET MVC cũ @model MobilePhone @using(Html.BeginForm(&quot;Add&quot;,&quot;MobilePhone&quot;,Method.Post)) &#123; &lt;label&gt;Id&lt;/label&gt; @Html.TextBoxFor(x =&gt; x.Id) &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt; @Html.TextBoxFor(x =&gt; x.Name) &#125; 3. Tự tạo project Từ khúc này trở đi, bạn sẽ cần phải làm theo từng bước một ASP.NET có kha khá phiên bản, MVC1, MVC2, MVC3, MVC4, và gần đây nhất là MVC5 và MVC Core. Từ version 5 trở xuống là cách phát triển cũ, chỉ chạy được trên môi trường Windows, từ phiên bản MVC Core trở lên là cách phát triển mới, có thể chạy được trên Linux, Windows hoặc MacOS. Nếu đang học, thì mình khuyến khích nên học luôn từ MVC Core trở lên luôn cho nó hot 3.1. Phần mềm cần thiết .NET Core SDK 2.0 trở lên Visual Studio Code VS Code C# extension 3.2. Triển Mở VSCode lên, nhấn Ctrl + ` để hiện Terminal, hoặc làm như hình dùng các lệnh cd để trỏ tới thư mục mong muốn tạo project của bạn hoặc gõ dotnet new mvc Bấm F5 &gt; Chọn .NET Core Nếu bạn được hỏi “Required assets to build and debug are missing from blah blah blah”, thì bấm Yes nhé Vậy là bạn đã tạo project MVC đầu tiên của mình, dùng ASP.NET Core rồi nhé. Bạn có thể mở class HomeController để hiểu rõ hơn về mô hình MVC mình vừa nói ở trên. 3.3. ASP.NET Convention ở trên mình có nhắc tới MobilePhoneController, thì đường dẫn của nó sẽ là &#x2F;MobilePhone, hay ở project bạn mới tạo, HomeController sẽ có đường dẫn là &#x2F;Home .ASP.NET tự hiểu controller của bạn, và sẽ có đường dẫn tương ứng. Mặc định, các method Index trong controller của bạn sẽ là method được gọi khi URL ko có bất kỳ cái gì đằng sau. Ví dụ như HomeController ở trên, nếu bạn chỉ nhập https://localhost:5000/Home/ thì method Index sẽ được gọi, View Index.cshtml sẽ được hiển thị. Như vậy, bạn đã hiểu khá đủ về mô hình MVC, ở phần tiếp theo mình sẽ tiếp tục nói về kết nối database và những thứ bạn có thể làm với Model cho đúng chuẩn nhé","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"beginner","slug":"beginner","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/beginner/"},{"name":"mvc","slug":"mvc","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/mvc/"}]},{"title":"[ASP.NET Core] - Razor Page - Let's think straight","slug":"asp-net-core-razor-page-lets-think-straight","date":"2018-03-03T10:00:24.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/03/asp-net-core-razor-page-lets-think-straight/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/03/03/asp-net-core-razor-page-lets-think-straight/","excerpt":"Khi bạn cần tạo thật nhanh một cái website có các page cần thiết mà không cần phải quan tâm tới các vấn đề phức tạp như mô hình, bảo mật, mở rộng, thì Razor Page chính là câu trả lời","text":"Khi bạn cần tạo thật nhanh một cái website có các page cần thiết mà không cần phải quan tâm tới các vấn đề phức tạp như mô hình, bảo mật, mở rộng, thì Razor Page chính là câu trả lời 1.

Yêu cầu .NET Core 2.0 trở lên Visual Studio Code Đọc sơ qua về Razor Page 2. Mô hình phát triểnNếu bạn đã là một chiến binh ASP.NET lâu năm, thì chắc hẳn bạn sẽ quen thuộc với mô hình MVC, viết tắt cho Model-View-Controller. Ở Razor Page, bạn sẽ làm quen với một mô hình hoàn toàn mới và vô cùng đơn giản (đơn giản tới mức ko có gì để học luôn) Mô hình MVC Nếu bạn muốn làm quen với mô hình MVC, có thể đọc bài viết [ASP.NET for Beginner] – Part 1 – MVC ‘Mô hình’ Razor Page 3. Các vấn đề của MVC3.1. Fat ControllerGiả sử bạn có một controller xử lý các tác vụ liên quan tới giao dịch chuyển tiền giữa các tài khoản, tạm gọi là TransactionController Có 4 thao tác cơ bản đối với 1 dòng dữ liệu: Create-Read-Update-Delete, tới đây thì ok không vấn đề gì Pặc, bạn muốn xử lý thêm việc nạp thẻ điện thoại, chi trả hóa đơn điện, nước, internet &#x3D;&gt; thêm các phương thức như NapTheCao, TraTienDien, TraTienNuoc, TraTienInternet. 2 tuần sau, bạn lại muốn thêm vài tính năng khác, tất cả đều liên quan tới transaction. Càng về sau, TransactionController càng dài, và nó đã chính thức được gọi tên là Fat Controller. 3.2. Chia cấpMô hình MVC cho bạn một folder tên Controllers để chứa tất cả các controller của bạn. Điều này sd4 tương ứng với 1 cấp địa chỉ trên URL Với ví dụ transaction phía trên, URL của bạn sẽ có dạng: domain/transaction/create Nếu bạn muốn 1 cấp sâu hơn, ví dụ như domain/transaction/phones/create thì sao? Bạn phải hoặc customize lại route, hoặc tạo một Area tên Transaction, và tách các function liên quan với nhau thành từng controller khác nhau. 3.3. DuplicateĐối với một form bất kỳ, trong mô hình mvc luôn phải có 2 action tương ứng với 2 hành động là Get và post, và người ta thường đặt tên 2 action này giống nhau cho dễ phân biệt với các tính năng khác trong cùng một controller. Điều này đôi khi gây ra những bất tiện nhất định, và bạn bắt buộc phải khai báo attribute [HttpGet] và [HttpPost] 4. Razor Page Coding conventionsTương tự như MVC, Razor Page cũng có một số coding conventions Conventions MVC RAZOR PAGES Default View Index.cshtml Index.cshtml return default view return View(); return Page(); Http Verbs [HttpGet][HttpPost] OnGet();OnPost(); Bind dữ liệu ViewModel [BindProperty] Generate Link Url.Action(…) Url.Page(…) multiple action for form submit Not built-in asp-page-handler&#x3D;“TestHandler”OnTestHandler() 5. The future is now?Razor Page, theo đánh giá của mình, chỉ phù hợp với các project vừa và nhỏ, với các view đơn giản về mật logic. Tại phiên bản .NET CORE 2.0, Razor Page vẫn chưa hỗ trợ một số tính năng mà MVC đang có như sau IActionFilter Output Cache IgnoreAntiforgeryToken attribute (bạn có thể tham khảo thêm tại github issue này để biết cách tắt toàn bộ)","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"page","slug":"page","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/page/"},{"name":"razor","slug":"razor","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/razor/"}]},{"title":"[ASP.NET Core] Auto Anti-forgery Token","slug":"asp-net-core-auto-anti-forgery-token","date":"2018-03-03T09:09:06.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/03/asp-net-core-auto-anti-forgery-token/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/03/03/asp-net-core-auto-anti-forgery-token/","excerpt":"Có một cách giúp bạn tự động áp dụng ValidateAntiForgeryToken vào tất cả các Post Action trong controller của mình","text":"Có một cách giúp bạn tự động áp dụng ValidateAntiForgeryToken vào tất cả các Post Action trong controller của mình 1.

Nếu bạn muốn áp dụng cho toàn bộ app Chắc bạn đã từng nghe qua Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Hiểu một cách đơn giản là Server thực thi một request giả mạo xuất phát từ hacker, nhưng với chứng thực xịn của 1 user nào đó. Điều này rất dễ thực hiện. Giả sử bạn truy cập 1 forum nào đó, trong đó có chứa đoạn javascript giả mạo 1 request tới ngân hàng của bạn, yêu cầu chuyển tiền.

Cho tới nay, mình tự hào đã dùng toàn bộ sản phẩm có bản quyền đàng hoàng, và thay thế hầu hết các phần mềm có bản quyền bằng các phần mềm miễn phí tương đương. Tuy còn nhiều điều chưa tiện, chưa thông minh, chưa đẹp như những phần mềm tính phí, nhưng nó là công sức của cả một cộng đồng lập trình viên, và điểm đặc biệt là nó update cực nhanh Cũng phải nói luôn là có một số phần mềm, mặc dù vẫn có thể dùng đồ free, nhưng tính năng nó mang lại không đủ, nên mình cũng đã quyết định bỏ tiền ra mua (một số) sản phẩm tính phí đó. 1. Phần mềm đã mua 1.1. Microsoft Office 2. Phần mềm có được do các chương trình hỗ trợ &#x2F; hợp tác 2.1. Microsoft Windows 2.2. Visual Studio Enterprise 3. Phần mềm đã bỏ 3.1. Internet Download Manager 3.2. Adobe Photoshop 3.3. Sublime Text 3.4. SourceTree, hay Git Client nói chung 4. Các phần mềm khác 1. Phần mềm đã mua1.1. Microsoft Office Alternative: * Libre Office * Open Office Bộ này thì khỏi nói, dù có một số giải pháp thay thế như Libre Office hay Open Office, nhưng về cơ bản, các tính năng quá mạnh mẽ của MS Office đã thuyết phục được mình bỏ tiền ra mua nó hàng năm (dạng thuê bao Home Subscription có thể chia sẻ cho 5 user) 2. Phần mềm có được do các chương trình hỗ trợ &#x2F; hợp tácCác chương trình này đa phần nhắm tới sinh viên. Nếu trường của bạn cung cấp địa chỉ có đuôi edu thì bạn sẽ được tham gia các chương trình này và sử dụng các bộ phần mềm bản quyền hoàn toàn miễn phí 2.1. Microsoft Windows Alternative: Ubuntu - và các hệ điều hành linux nói chung Thông qua chương trình DreamSpark (trước là MSDN AA). Bản quyền Windows vẫn tính trên licence cụ thể. Đối với Windows 10, MS có bổ sung thêm dạng license điện tử đi kèm với tài khoản Windows của bạn. Mình không có nhiều máy để thử cái này, nhưng mình nghĩ tương lai Windows tiến tới miễn phí hoàn toàn bản quyền là không còn xa (MS sẽ đè doanh nghiệp ra mà hút máu với các bản Ultimate và Windows Server) 2.2. Visual Studio Enterprise Alternative: Visual Studio có bản miễn phí là Visual Studio Community Visual Studio là một bộ IDE siêu siêu mạnh. Bạn có thể dùng nó để phát triển hầu như tất cả các sản phẩm phần mềm. Hồi đó mình còn học tin học đại cương (học lập trình C++ các kiểu) ở trường, thì thiếu 1 cái IDE như này. Lên mạng mày mò thì cũng ra kha khá các phần mềm như Code Blocks, hay Borland Turbo C++ (cái này không miễn phí, nhưng mà nó cổ quá rồi). Sau này cũng ráng cài Eclipse, rồi NetBeans Khi ‘phát hiện’ ra Visual Studio 2010 Express (là phiên bản miễn phí hồi đó), mình…bỏ luôn mấy cái khác, và xài nó từ đó tới giờ Funfact: MS cũng tham gia phát triển tools cho eclipse -&gt; source 3. Phần mềm đã bỏ3.1. Internet Download Manager Alternative: Free Download Manager IDM giống như một phần mềm phải-có của bất kỳ cái máy tính nào. Khi mạng mẽo thì bị cá mập cắn liên tục, băng thông thì cứ tới giờ là bóp, đường truyền như quay số ò e í e tới ADSL. IDM giúp bạn vượt qua các khó khăn đó. Và mỗi khi IDM ra mắt version, thì cư dân mạng lại thay phiên nhau update crack. Đã qua rồi cái thời cứ lâu lâu lại phải tìm crack cho IDM một lần, lướt youtube có cái popup nho nhỏ show ra đòi download, vân vân và vân vân. Toàn bộ các tính năng mà IDM có, FDM cũng có, và có phần tốt hơn Download youtube video: Copy link youtube rồi dán vào khung Add download Download toàn bộ site: Dùng FDM version 3.9, tính năng Site Explorer Bắt link nhạc nhẽo, video: Click chuột phải vào khung play &gt; Download this Video with Free Download Manager FDM khắc phục một số nhược điểm mà IDM gặp phải: * Không phải nối file sau khi download xong: Nó tạo sẵn khoảng trống trên ổ cứng, vào download từng phần rồi ghi vào các khoảng trống đó * Download được torrent 3.2. Adobe Photoshop Alternative: GIMP + VirtualDub + Capture One for Sony Adobe Photoshop thì không cần phải nói nhiều. Để tìm được tool thay thế cho nó, mình đã phải tốn kha khá thời gian và công sức, nhưng vẫn chưa thật sự hài lòng. Xưa kia mình dùng chủ yếu Camera Raw của Adobe Photoshop để chỉnh ảnh Raw từ cái máy Sony của mình. Sony cũng cung cấp một bộ phần mềm giúp chỉnh ảnh raw luôn là Capture One Express, nhưng thiết kế của nó không tiện như Camera Raw, và tốc độ của nó cũng có vẻ không bằng. Máy Sony của mình có thể chụp 11 tấm &#x2F; 1 giây, ghép lại thành một cái ảnh động. Photoshop hỗ trợ cái này rất tự nhiên luôn. Thay thế cho nó là Virtual Dub, xuất ra file AVI nhưng với một bộ codec khá lạ lùng và khá khó xài GIMP là bộ phần mềm chính thay thế cho Photoshop, điểm mạnh của nó là open source, điểm yếu của nó là update rất chậm. 3.3. Sublime Text Alternative: Visual Studio Code Sublime Text là một dạng phần mềm như kiểu WinRar, bạn có thể ‘evaluate’ nó mãi mãi, nhưng nhìn chung, nó vẫn là một phần mềm có tính phí bản quyền Về cơ bản, nó là một Text Editor mạnh mẽ với các tính năng như multi cursor, hỗ trợ extension, tốc độ cực nhanh, có Command Pallete giúp bạn kha khá các tác vụ thủ công lặp đi lặp lại. Tuy nhiên, tất cả những cái đó đều đã và đang bị VS Code dần dần lấn lướt (trừ cái tốc độ ra) 3.4. SourceTree, hay Git Client nói chung Alternative: GitExtension Một số bạn dev sẽ cực lực phản đổi cái git extension này, vì giao diện nó…quá xấu so với quy định. Đã từng có một thời gian, mình cũng đã như vậy. Mình cũng ‘cự tuyệt’ với GitExtension vì giao diện của nó. Nhưng mặt trời chân lý đã chói qua tim mình, khi mà SourceTree bug tè le hột me, các phần mềm khác thì quá đơn giản so với nhu cầu sử dụng (GitKraken, GitHub Desktop) Tất cả đều không thể vượt qua nổi sự đơn giản (tuy xấu) và ổn định mà GitExtension cung cấp. 4. Các phần mềm khácMục tiêu của mình là open source, chứ không phải freeware, hay freemium. 7-zip: Giải nén Unikey: Gõ tiếng Việt Greenshot: Chụp ảnh màn hình Các phần mềm miễn phí có thể thay thế bằng web Zalo: https://chat.zalo.me/ Slack Trello Skype: https://web.skype.com/ -&gt; Tuy nhiên, vào buổi chiều nó hay bị quá tải, nên phải chuyển sang dùng skype thường Còn bạn thì sao?

May mắn là vẫn có cách 1. Computed Property 2. Simple LINQ 3. Solution 3.1. [Slow performance] Gọi ToList 3.2. [DRY Principle violated] Viết biểu thức 4. The best solution 5. Make life easier 1. Computed Property Là một property chỉ có hàm get, và trong get đó, giá trị trả về được tính toán dựa trên các property khác public class TestViewModel &#123; [Required] [MaxLength(10, ErrorMessage = &quot;Length must fewer than &#123;1&#125;&quot;)] public string FirstName &#123; get; set; &#125; [Required] [StringLength(10)] public string LastName &#123; get; set; &#125; // Computed Property [NotMapped] public string FullName =&gt; FirstName + LastName; &#125; Theo các chuẩn thiết kế database, một column phải chứa dữ liệu mà không thể được suy ra từ các dữ liệu khác. Đoạn Attribute [NotMapped] phục vụ cho việc đó. EF sẽ không sinh ra code generate column FullName nếu bạn dùng code first, không cố gắng tìm column FullName trong table nếu bạn dùng database first 2. Simple LINQ Để query một giá trị nào đó trong Database dùng Entity Framework, bạn có thể dùng LINQ rất đơn giản như sau // TableNameWithS is your table name in plural var names = dbContext.TableNameWithS.Where(x =&gt; x.FirstName.Contains(&quot;test&quot;)); Nhưng cũng đoạn code đó sẽ gây lỗi nếu bạn cố gắn dùng nó với Property FullName // BUG BUG BUG var names = dbContext.TableNameWithS.Where(x =&gt; x.FullName.Contains(&quot;test&quot;)); 3. Solution TL;DR: The best solution 3.1. [Slow performance] Gọi ToList var names = dbContext.TableNameWithS.ToList().Where(x =&gt; x.FullName.Contains(&quot;test&quot;)); Gọi ToList sẽ làm Entity Framework gọi tới database, thực thi bất kỳ đoạn query nào trước đó, rồi mới thực thi tới đoạn LINQ có computed property của bạn Nhược điểm của nó là EF sẽ query ra kết quả nhiều hơn so với cần thiết, làm giảm performance của ứng dụng 3.2. [DRY Principle violated] Viết biểu thức Một cách khác là thay vì sử dụng computed property, ta có thể viết thẳng biểu thức của property đó vào câu query var names = dbContext.TableNameWithS.Where(x =&gt; (x.FirstName + x.LastName).Contains(&quot;test&quot;)); Nhược điểm của cách này là bạn đã vi phạm nguyên tắc “DRY” - Don’t repeat yourself. Một biểu thức mà phải code tới 2 lần. Nếu sau này bạn thay đổi biểu thức đó ở 1 chỗ, thì ở chỗ còn lại bạn cũng sẽ phải đổi theo. Nếu bạn quên -&gt; BUG ngay và luôn The DRY principle is stated as “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system” Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself 4. The best solution DelegateDecompiler - Một bộ thư viện cực khủng giúp bạn decompile biểu thức của computed property, và translate chúng thành LINQ, EF sau đó sẽ translate nó thành câu lệnh SQL. Nhược điểm của nó là nó không thể dịch được khi bạn sử dụng các method, class mà bạn tự định nghĩa, không nằm trong .NET Framework Sử dụng nó thì không còn gì dễ hơn Bước 1: Cài đặt nuget DelegateDecompiler Install-Package DelegateDecompiler Bước 2: Trang trí property với attribute [Computed] public class TestViewModel &#123; [Required] [MaxLength(10, ErrorMessage = &quot;Length must fewer than &#123;1&#125;&quot;)] public string FirstName &#123; get; set; &#125; [Required] [StringLength(10)] public string LastName &#123; get; set; &#125; // Computed Property [NotMapped] [Computed] public string FullName =&gt; FirstName + LastName; &#125; Bước 3: Gọi method Decompile var names = dbContext.TableNameWithS .ToList() .Where(x =&gt; x.FullName.Contains(&quot;test&quot;)).Decompile(); Thư viện này thậm chí còn hỗ trợ async, các advanced functions của EF như Include, AsNoTracking với phần mở rộng DelegateDecompiler.EntityFramework 5. Make life easier Bạn cũng có thể cấu hình cho asp tự xử lý các property có [NotMapped] Tạo một class Configuration public class DelegateDecompilerConfiguration : DefaultConfiguration &#123; public override bool ShouldDecompile(MemberInfo memberInfo) &#123; // Automatically decompile all NotMapped members return base.ShouldDecompile(memberInfo) || memberInfo.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(NotMappedAttribute), true).Length &gt; 0; &#125; &#125; Rồi đăng ký nó trong method Startup như sau DelegateDecompiler.Configuration .Configure(new DelegateDecompilerConfiguration());","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Computed Property","slug":"Computed-Property","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Computed-Property/"},{"name":"LINQ","slug":"LINQ","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/LINQ/"},{"name":"Query","slug":"Query","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Query/"}]},{"title":"[asp.net mvc] Error Message - chung mà riêng","slug":"asp-net-mvc-error-message-chung-ma-rieng","date":"2018-01-14T10:00:42.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/01/14/asp-net-mvc-error-message-chung-ma-rieng/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2018/01/14/asp-net-mvc-error-message-chung-ma-rieng/","excerpt":"Bạn có đang dùng Entity Framework với ASP.NET MVC, cùng với đó là client-validation?

Generic Customized Error Message 2. Error Message Localization 2.1. Nếu bạn có Resharper 2.2. Nếu bạn muốn dùng hàng miễn phí 1. Generic Customized Error Message Generic tức là chung chung. Dùng chung 1 câu thông báo cho nhiều property cùng loại, chỉ thay đổi các yếu tố cần thiết Ví dụ: Tên phải chứa ít hơn 15 ký tự Địa chỉ phải chứa ít hơn 150 ký tự Trong ví dụ trên, phần tên, địa chỉ, 15, 150 là những tham số ta phải thay đổi cho câu thông báo.

Vấn đề với label tag helper label là cái tag mà bạn sẽ customize hơi nhiều trong ứng dụng asp.net core của mình. Lý do là vì bạn muốn nó có thêm một dấu * màu đỏ đối với các input yêu cầu bắt buộc, bạn cũng muốn nó có thêm (500 ký tự) khi ô input chỉ cho phép nhập 500 ký tự. Tất nhiên, tất cả những cái đó đều có thể thêm vào dễ dàng bằng cách … add tay ASP.NET MVC, và sau này là ASP.NET CORE, cho phép bạn xây dựng model với các DataAnnotation nhằm khai báo cho cơ sở dữ liệu biết các giới hạn hoặc định nghĩa của một column trên database, đồng thời giúp bạn validate input field của nó ở client-side code [Required] [Display(Name = &quot;User name&quot;)] [StringLenght(15)] public string Username &#123; get; set; &#125; Tuy nhiên, khi tạo input field cho property username này, bạn vẫn phải tự tạo tay các dấu * và dòng chữ tối đa 15 ký tự kia &lt;label asp-for=&quot;Username&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input asp-for=&quot;Username&quot;/&gt; &lt;span asp-validation-for=&quot;Username&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; đoạn code trên sẽ generate ra các dòng html sau &lt;label for=&quot;Username&quot;&gt;User name&lt;/label&gt; ....các dòng khác... 3.

MS thấy vậy nhảy vào và ASP.NET Membership ra đời Version này cực kỳ hạn chế + DB được thiết kế cho SQL Server, và ko thể thay đổi + Tuy các provider được thiết kể để có thể thay đổi, nhưng mà hàng loạt hardcode + tư duy chắc chắn phải dùng SQL server của dev khiến việc thay đổi này vô cùng cực khổ + Ko xài được OWIN 1.2.

Asp.net Identity Sau quá nhiều feedback, asp.net team cho ra đời version này, khắc phục mấy cái hạn chế trên kia. Có thể xài chung cho nhiều Framework (MVC, Forms, Web Pages, Web API, SingalR) Dễ gắn thêm field vào user profile Có thể gắn các Storage khác vô ngoài SQL Server (bớt đau khổ hơn tí) Unit test được Dùng claims (sẽ giải thích sau) OWIN tốt Support Azure Active Directory Cài được bằng Nuget Bắt đầu nhảy vô nhé 2.

Kết nối tới database Mặc định, Identity dùng connection string có tên “DefaultConnection” Mở Models/IdentityModels public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; &#123; public ApplicationDbContext() : base(&quot;DefaultConnection&quot;, throwIfV1Schema: false) &#123; &#125; public static ApplicationDbContext Create() &#123; return new ApplicationDbContext(); &#125; &#125; Mở Web.config, kiếm DefaultConnection, bạn sẽ thấy connection string của nó nối tới Database &lt;connectionStrings&gt; &lt;add name=&quot;DefaultConnection&quot; connectionString=&quot;Data Source=(LocalDb)\\\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\\\aspnet-LearnIdentity2-20170824112720.mdf;Initial Catalog=aspnet-LearnIdentity2-20170824112720;Integrated Security=True&quot; providerName=&quot;System.Data.SqlClient&quot; /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt; Như vậy, Identity, tùy theo framework bạn sử dụng, sẽ dùng LocalDb hoặc SQL Server Dùng SQL Server Management Studio connect tới db này, bạn sẽ thấy nó đang nằm chình ình trong đó Vậy bạn có tự hỏi làm sao mà mới chỉ chạy project thôi mà Identity đã tạo được database? 3.1.2. Code first Để trả lời cho câu hỏi đó, từ EF4, MS đã giới thiệu một hướng tiếp cận hoàn toàn mới gọi là Code first, bên cạnh hướng tiếp cận truyền thống là Database First như xưa nay. Với hướng tiếp cận này, Dev chỉ cần tập trung vào code của mình, db sẽ do EF tạo ra ứng với code của dev Một flow cơ bản là Dev viết các model và class -&gt; Nhấn F5 -&gt; EF tạo &#x2F; map database -&gt; Ứng dụng khởi chạy với datbase được tạo &#x2F; map 3.1.3. Cấu trúc Identity tạo ra 5 bảng trong DB, và mỗi bảng đều liên hệ với nhau Tất cả các trường Id đều dùng nvarchar(128), giá trị lưu trữ là code GUID 3.2. Kiến trúc và các khái niệm 3.2.1. AspNetUsers PasswordHash Identity ko lưu trữ trực tiếp password theo dạng plain text (đề phòng trường hợp Db của bạn bị hack, hacker cũng ko biết password) ASP.NETIdentty2/src/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Core/Crypto.cs Identity Hash password của bạn dựa trên 1 chuỗi salt 128 bit. Nói chung về thuật toán mã hóa bạn cũng ko cần phải quan tâm :D Trong Identity Core, thuật toán này có thay đổi, nên việc convert từ Identity 2 lên 3 sẽ cần configure lại đôi chút SecurityStamp Về cơ bản, SecurityStamp được dùng để xác thực một request nào đó. Giả sử như bạn đổi pass ở máy này, nhưng trên máy khác vẫn lưu cookie, thì ngay khi đổi pass xong, SecurityStamp thay đổi, cookie trên tất cả các máy khác sẽ mất hiệu lực 3.2.2. AspNetUserLogins Bảng này chịu trách nhiệm cho việc login bằng account của các dịch vụ thứ 3 như Google, Facebook, Twitter,… LoginProvider Là tên của Service được dùng để login (ví dụ “Facebook”, “Google”) ProviderKey Là một key ko trùng lặp do service cung cấp cho bạn, key này gắn liền với tài khoản của bạn tại service đó Cả 3 field này kết hợp tạo thành khóa chính. Tức là 1 user có thể đăng nhập bằng nhiều dịch vụ khác nhau Bảng này cho phép Identity dùng OWIN 3.2.3. AspNetUserClaims claim là một hành vi mô mà một chủ thể nào đó tuyên bố điều gì đó về chính nó hoặc về các chủ thể khác. Ví dụ: User A claim rằng A có quyền xem hình Claim-base Security Identity hỗ trợ 2 kiểu Security là Role-base Security và Claim-base Security. Về role-base security sẽ nói trong đoạn tiếp theo của bài blog này Một ví dụ thực tiễn Claim-base Security có mặt xung quanh chúng ta. Một ví dụ thực tiễn là khi bạn đi máy bay. Khi đi, bạn phải mang theo CMND&#x2F;Passport + vé máy bay: Authentication: Nhân viên kiểm soát sẽ kiểm tra khuôn mặt của bạn với CMND&#x2F;Passport Authorization: Nhân viên kiểm tra vé của bạn xem có đúng là vé thiệt ko, ngồi ở hàng nào, ghế nào, sau cùng xuất ra cho bạn một tấm boarding passNhư vậy, tấm boarding pass này chứa khá nhiều thông tin: số chuyến bay, ghế ngồi, tên hành khách, và nhiều khi còn có thêm một dải băng từ màu đen ở mặt sau chứa mã số đã được mã hóa của tấm boarding pass đó nhằm chứng tỏ nó là một tấm boarding pass thiệt, ko phải đồ giả. Tấm boarding pass này chính là 1 tập hợp các claim, được xuất ra bởi một issuer. Khi bạn tới sân bay, trình các claim này ra, nhân viên sẽ đơn giản đối chiếu các claim này với database và cho bạn lên máy bay. Cũng cần lưu ý là tấm boarding pass này có thể được xuất bởi nhiều nguồn: trực tiếp tại quầy làm thủ tục, hay đại lý vé máy bay. Những nguồn này gọi là issuer Trong phần mềm, tập hợp các claim này gọi là security token. Mỗi security token được ký bởi một issuer đã tạo ra nó. Một ứng dụng có claim-base security yêu cầu user phải xác thực tài khoản của mình, và tùy vào các claim mà họ có để cấp các quyền cần thiết. Role-base Security Ngoài claim, Identity còn cung cấp cho bạn một Role-base Security nữa Role thì dễ hiểu rồi. Một user có thể được thêm vào nhiều role, và mỗi role sẽ cho user đó một số quyền hạn nhất định Trong bài viết tiếp theo, chúng ta sẽ cùng đi vào tìm hiểu về code của ASP.NET Identity nhé Xem code ở đây: ASP.NET Identity 2 clone on GitHub","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"identity","slug":"identity","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/identity/"}]},{"title":"Wordpress - Install Wordpress to Docker containers from Windows","slug":"wordpress-install-wordpress-to-docker-containers-from-windows","date":"2017-08-02T04:18:56.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/08/02/wordpress-install-wordpress-to-docker-containers-from-windows/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2017/08/02/wordpress-install-wordpress-to-docker-containers-from-windows/","excerpt":"In this tutorial, I will guide your through on how to install wordpress on a container of docker.

Một điểm hạn chế của 2 thằng này là chúng không tạo ra input cho các class tùy biến của bạn Còn 1 list các item thì lại càng không có. Hiển thị một list thì dễ, một vòng lặp for (hoặc foreach) là xong Nhưng một “Editor” cho cả một list thì ko được support, nên bạn phải tự tạo thôi Từ một bài viết thú vị từ Matt Lunn ở đây, chúng ta sẽ thay đổi một tí cho dễ xài và phù hợp với yêu cầu hơn nhóe 2.

JavaScript Code Đoạn code dưới dây dùng JQuery, nhưng bạn có thể convert nó sang JavaScript thuần cũng vẫn được nhóe function GenerateGuid() &#123; function s4() &#123; return Math.floor((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000) .toString(16) .substring(1); &#125; return s4() + s4() + &quot;-&quot; + s4() + &quot;-&quot; + s4() + &quot;-&quot; + s4() + &quot;-&quot; + s4() + s4() + s4(); &#125; function AssignAddMoreButton() &#123; $(&quot;.add-more-button&quot;).click(function (event) &#123; event.preventDefault(); debugger; var id = &quot;#&quot; + $(this).data(&quot;class&quot;); var clone = $(id).children().last().clone(); var guid = clone.children().first().val(); var regex = new RegExp(guid, &quot;g&quot;); var newHtml = clone.html(function (i, oldHtml) &#123; return oldHtml.replace(regex, GenerateGuid()); &#125;); $(id).append(newHtml); &#125;); &#125; 3. Cách xài 3.1. Chuẩn bị model Cái model mà bạn muốn dùng với cái control EditorForMany này, bạn phải thêm một property là Index vô nữa Ví dụ, nếu tui có một cái class tên là Model luôn public class Model &#123; // Your normal, already existed properties // set to false if you don&#x27;t want to generate a HTML input tag // for it when using with editorfor control [ScaffoldColumn(false)] public string Index &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; 3.2. Razor code @using(Html.BeginForm(&quot;ActionName&quot;,&quot;ControllerName&quot;,FormMethod.Post, new &#123;@class=&quot;CssClassName&quot;&#125;)) &#123; // the last parameter &quot;true&quot; is to generate a default item @Html.EditorForMany(x =&gt; x.Model, x =&gt; x.Index, true) &#125; // include the javascript code file above AssignAddMoreButton(); Nếu bạn muốn đặt toàn bộ code javascript vào một file .js, nhớ gọi function AssignAddMoreButton sau khi “document ready” nhóe 4. Kết quả Kết quả nó sẽ giống vầy (có thêm style của bootstrap nữa nha) 5. Cách hoạt động HtmlHelperExtensions chính là chỗ mà điều kỳ diệu xảy ra. Keyword Extensions sẽ “đăng ký” nó thành một extension của HtmlHelper 5.1. Các bước Về cơ bản, nó sẽ làm những bước sau Lấy danh sách Items Lấy Index property (nếu bạn có khai báo index) Generate một item default mới (nếu bạn kêu nó làm thế) Dựng code HTML &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- List of your html input tag generated by editorfor and extended templates --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 5.2. Tại sao lại cần Index Có 2 cách để send một list data tới controller dùng một mảng có đánh số xóa 1 item sẽ làm lộn xộn cả list, controller chỉ nhận mảng liên tục thêm mới 1 item thì cần phải biết index cuối cùng là bao nhiêu &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;YourList[0].Data&quot;/&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;YourList[1].Data&quot;/&gt; dùng mảng có index dạng string yêu cầu thêm một tag input ẩn để chứa index dễ thêm, xóa, sửa item &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;YourList.Index&quot; value=&quot;radomGuid1&quot;/&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;YourList[randomGuid1].Data&quot;/&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;YourList.Index&quot; value=&quot;anotherGuid2&quot;/&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;YourList[anotherGuid2].Data&quot;/&gt; Như bạn cũng thấy, giá trị của hidden input tag có thể là bất cứ gì, miễn là giá trị trong ngoặc vuông giống với nó. Bước 1 bước xa hơn, đoạn code javascript bên trên sẽ tạo ra index dạng GUID, cho nên bạn sẽ không phải lo về vấn đề trùng lặp index. Tuy nhiên, nó ko phải là GUID thiệt, vì để generate GUID thiệt sẽ hơi phức tạp, và làm cho app nặng lên, giống như xài tên lửa đi giết ruồi, cho nên để cho đơn giản, đoạn code đó chỉ sinh ra “fake” GUID, nhưng theo cách code thì khó mà trùng được Theo bạn, bạn có cách nào cải tiến đoạn code bên trên không?","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"editorfor","slug":"editorfor","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/editorfor/"},{"name":"ajax","slug":"ajax","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/ajax/"},{"name":"editorformany","slug":"editorformany","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/editorformany/"},{"name":"list","slug":"list","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/list/"}]},{"title":"[ASP.NET] Mở rộng EditorFor","slug":"asp-net-mo-rong-editorfor","date":"2017-04-20T04:26:01.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/04/20/asp-net-mo-rong-editorfor/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2017/04/20/asp-net-mo-rong-editorfor/","excerpt":"Chắc là bạn đã quá quen với EditorFor control, nhưng nó chỉ render khi gặp những kiểu dữ liệu được hỗ trợ thôi.

Bạn sẽ làm gì nếu muốn mở rộng EditorFor để render những kiểu dữ liệu của riêng bạn? Mục lục 1. Sử dụng EditorFor và EditorForModel Model (hoặc ViewModel) View 2. Mở rộng EditorFor 2.1 Tạo EditorTemplates Có thể nói EditorFor và EditorForModel là những control hữu ích nhất khi mà nó có thể render cái bụp toàn bộ thẻ input cần thiết dựa trên một model của bạn. 1. Sử dụng EditorFor và EditorForModelTại sao chả thấy ai nói gì về Editor: Từ hồi MVC2, Editor control đi kèm với phiên bản đầu tiên của MVC có thể được thay thế bởi EditorFor. Từ “For” ám chỉ đây là một strongly typed html helper, tức là bạn có thể chọn tên property từ model mà không sợ sai Model (hoặc ViewModel)Để render 1 cái form, bạn cần phải biết data nó nhận vô là gì. Để hiển thị những data này, bạn cần phải tạo một class với các Properties Model public class Lesson &#123; // ScaffoldColumn mark that EditorFor should render it or not [ScaffoldColumn(false)] public int Id &#123; get; set; &#125; // To display as label [Display(Name = &quot;Lesson Name&quot;)] public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; [Display(Name = &quot;CD Number&quot;)] public int CDNumber &#123; get; set; &#125; [Display(Name = &quot;CD Track&quot;)] public int CDTrack &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; ViewModel public class LessonViewModel &#123; public Lesson LessonItem &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; View EditorFor control phải nằm bên trong form tag Razor support bạn render cái form tag đó tự động luôn @model LessonViewModel @using(Html.BeginForm(&quot;ActionName&quot;,&quot;ControllerName&quot;, FormMethod.Post,new &#123;@class = &quot;myformclass&quot;&#125;)) &#123; @Html.EditorFor(x =&gt; x.LessonItem) &#125; Nếu bạn không có ViewModel, nhưng muốn render trực tiếp từ Lesson model @model Lesson @using(Html.BeginForm(&quot;ActionName&quot;,&quot;ControllerName&quot;, FormMethod.Post,new &#123;@class = &quot;myformclass&quot;&#125;)) &#123; @Html.EditorForModel() &#125; 2. Mở rộng EditorForTạo một class mới để giữ data public class TextBoxWithCheck &#123; [Display(Name = &quot;Fancy Text&quot;)] public string MyText &#123; get; set;&#125; public bool IsTrue &#123; get; set; &#125; &#125; Thêm cái class mới này vô Lesson model public TextBoxWithCheck FancyBox &#123; get; set; &#125; Rồi giờ nếu bạn muốn một cái textbox có kèm checkbox giống vầy Rõ ràng là chả có cái default control nào có thể làm được trò này, mà EditorFor cũng không biết chọn cái gì để render cái property “FancyBox” của kiểu “TextBoxWithCheck”. Vì thế, bạn sẽ dạy nó cách render nhóe. 2.1 Tạo EditorTemplates Tạo folder “EditorTemplates” trong Views &gt; Shared Thêm View mới vào folder đó, đặt tên là “TextBoxWithCheck.cshtml” (phải trùng tên với cái custom class) @model TextBoxWithCheck @Html.LabelFor(x =&gt; x.MyText) &lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt; @Html.TextAreaFor(x =&gt; x.Answer, new &#123;@class=&quot;form-control&quot;&#125;) &lt;span class=&quot;input-group-addon&quot;&gt; @Html.CheckBoxFor(x =&gt; x.IsTrue) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Thế là xong. Giờ EditorFor đã biết render tất cả instance của TextBoxWithCheck. Cũng dễ mà phải không?","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Others","slug":"Others","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Others/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[{"name":"custom","slug":"custom","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/custom/"},{"name":"editorfor","slug":"editorfor","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/editorfor/"},{"name":"extend","slug":"extend","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/extend/"},{"name":"mở rộng","slug":"mo-rong","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/mo-rong/"}]},{"title":"[Front-end] Tự động reload browser khi đang code","slug":"front-end-tu-dong-reload-browser-khi-dang-code","date":"2017-04-12T08:56:00.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.567Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/04/12/front-end-tu-dong-reload-browser-khi-dang-code/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2017/04/12/front-end-tu-dong-reload-browser-khi-dang-code/","excerpt":"Mỗi lần nói tới CSS, là các front-end developer lại thấy chán nản mệt mỏi các kiểu Thử nghĩ xem, mỗi lần sửa CSS (hoặc SCSS), bạn sẽ phải quay lại web browser, nhấn reload &#x2F; F5 &#x2F; Ctrl + F5 Nếu có cách để browser tự động reload mỗi khi có thay đổi code thì sao nhỉ Bài viết này sẽ hướng dẫn các bạn dùng Visual Studio Code kèm với NodeJs để có tự động reload web khi có code thay đổi","text":"Mỗi lần nói tới CSS, là các front-end developer lại thấy chán nản mệt mỏi các kiểu Thử nghĩ xem, mỗi lần sửa CSS (hoặc SCSS), bạn sẽ phải quay lại web browser, nhấn reload &#x2F; F5 &#x2F; Ctrl + F5 Nếu có cách để browser tự động reload mỗi khi có thay đổi code thì sao nhỉ Bài viết này sẽ hướng dẫn các bạn dùng Visual Studio Code kèm với NodeJs để có tự động reload web khi có code thay đổi Mục lục Bước 1: Cài đặt môi trường Bước 2: Cài đặt các nodejs package Bước 3: Cài đặt ở local folder Bước 4: Cài đặt BrowserSync Bước 5: Tạo gulp task Chạy tasks Bước 1: Cài đặt môi trườngSẽ có một số phần mềm cần bạn cài đặt. Những phần mềm này khá phổ biến https://nodejs.org https://code.visualstudio.com/ Bạn có thể chọn bản LTS, viết tắt cho chữ Long term support. Đây thường là phiên bản ổn định, ít lỗi lặt vặt Bước 2: Cài đặt các nodejs packageMở Visual Studio Code Mở Terminal Windows Bật Terminal Windows trong Visual Studio Code bằng cách nhấn Ctrl + ` hoặc View &gt; Integrated Terminal Cài đặt trình biên dịch SASS&#x2F;LESS npm install -g node-sass less Tham số -g là để cài đặt trên môi trường global Sau khi cài đặt SASS&#x2F;LESS compiler Cài đặt gulp toolkit Cài đặt gulp toolkit để tự động hóa quá trình biên dịch npm install -g gulp Bạn có thể bỏ qua các warning khi cài đặt gulp Initialize Node.Js Nếu trước đó, bạn chưa bao giờ cài đặt NodeJs package manager, bạn sẽ gặp lỗi như sau Gõ lệnh npm init để init các tham số cần thiết cho npm và làm theo hướng dẫn trên màn hình. Nếu bạn không nhập gì cả và nhấn enter, npm sẽ dùng tham số default Bước 3: Cài đặt ở local folderMặc dù bạn đã cài gulp ở global, nhưng bạn vẫn sẽ cần gulp được “copy” vào folder có chứa project của bạn. Lý do là khi gulp global được upgrade, hoặc bị xóa mất, gulp local của bạn vẫn chạy bình thường với một bản sao ổn định trong project folder của bạn Cài đặt gulp local npm install gulp --save-dev Cài đặt gulp plugin npm install gulp gulp-sass gulp-less Bước 4: Cài đặt BrowserSyncBrowserSync chính là thứ sẽ giúp chúng ta tự động reload trình duyệt Cũng trong Terminal Windows của Visual Studio, gõ lệnh npm install browser-sync gulp --save-dev Tương tự, bạn cũng có thể bỏ qua các đoạn warning, thông báo Bước 5: Tạo gulp taskGulp task là một file .json có chứa các lệnh, tham số cần thiết để thiết lập cho gulp Trong Visual Studio Code, mở folder có chứa project HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JavaScript của bạn File &gt; Open Folder &gt; \\[Chọn folder\\] Tạo một file tên “gulpfile.js” trong root folder của project Gõ nội dung sau: var gulp = require(&#x27;gulp&#x27;); var sass = require(&#x27;gulp-sass&#x27;); var browserSync = require(&#x27;browser-sync&#x27;); // compile task var gulp = require(&#x27;gulp&#x27;); var sass = require(&#x27;gulp-sass&#x27;); var browserSync = require(&#x27;browser-sync&#x27;); // compile task gulp.task(&#x27;sass&#x27;, function () &#123; gulp.src(&#x27;css/*.scss&#x27;) .pipe(sass()) .on(&#x27;error&#x27;, swallowError) .pipe(gulp.dest(function (f) &#123; return f.base; &#125;)) .pipe(browserSync.stream()); &#125;); // browser sync init gulp.task(&#x27;browser-sync&#x27;, [&#x27;sass&#x27;], function () &#123; browserSync.init(&#123; server: &#123; baseDir: &quot;./&quot; &#125; &#125;); &#125;); // watch for changes in html, css, scss gulp.task(&#x27;default&#x27;, [&#x27;browser-sync&#x27;], function () &#123; gulp.watch(&#x27;css/*.scss&#x27;, [&#x27;sass&#x27;]); gulp.watch(&#x27;*.html&#x27;) .on(&#x27;change&#x27;, browserSync.reload); &#125;) // skip if error occured function swallowError(error) &#123; console.log(error.toString()) this.emit(&#x27;end&#x27;) &#125; Tạo tasks.json tasks.json giúp cho Visual Studio code biết cách chạy task gulp khi được ra lệnh Nhấn Ctrl + Shift + P và gõ “Configure Task Runner” rồi nhấn enter Chọn Others trong danh sách Gõ vào đoạn code sau &#123; &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1.0&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gulp&quot;, &quot;isShellCommand&quot;: true, &quot;tasks&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;taskName&quot;: &quot;default&quot;, &quot;isBuildCommand&quot;: true, &quot;showOutput&quot;: &quot;always&quot;, &quot;isBackground&quot;: true &#125; ] &#125; Chạy tasks Tạo file “index.html” trong thư mục gốc.

Update 6.3. Delete 1. Overview Nếu bạn chưa biết API là gì API là viết tắt của cụm từ Application Programming Interface, là một dạng giao diện cho phép bạn tương tác với một dữ liệu nào đó. Ví dụ như Uber chả hạn, bật app Uber lên, bạn sẽ thấy có vài xe Uber đang đậu quanh bạn. Làm sao Uber biết chuyện này? Bằng cách gửi tọa độ GPS của bạn lên server, và server sẽ trả về vị trí các xe đang rảnh xung quanh bạn. App Uber sẽ gắn nó lên trên bản đồ. Đây sẽ là các API mà chúng ta sẽ build API Description Request body Response body GET &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo Get all to-do items None Array of to-do items GET &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo&#x2F;{id} Get an item by ID None To-do item POST &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo Add a new item To-do item To-do item PUT &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo&#x2F;{id} Update an existing item To-do item None DELETE &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo&#x2F;{id} Delete an item. None None Sơ đồ Chú thích View: app &#x2F; web sẽ sử dụng API. Tạm thời chúng ta chưa quan tâm tới nó Model: là kiểu dữ liệu của bạn. Trong ví dụ này, Model là To-do item Controller: là thứ sẽ nhận HTTP Request, và tạo ra HTTP Responses. Ví dụ này sẽ chỉ có 1 controller duy nhất Ví dụ này cũng không sử dụng Database, mà sẽ lưu trực tiếp trên bộ nhớ. Một API hoàn chỉnh sẽ có Database đi kèm nó 2. Tools Đễ dễ dàng debug, test API do mình tạo ra, bạn có thể sử dụng một số phần mềm 2.1. Fiddler Tải và cài đặt tại đây: https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler 2.2. Google Chrome Google Chrome thì khá tốt trong chuyện test tiếc các kiểu 3. Start 3.1. Khởi tạo Project Tạo mới 1 project, chọn template là ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core), đặt tên là todoapi &gt; OK Chọn template là Web API &gt; OK 3.2. Thêm model Model là một object đại diện cho dữ liệu của bạn trong ứng dụng. Trong ví dụ này thì model duy nhất chỉ là một to-do item thôi. Tips: bạn nên đặt toàn bộ model trong một folder riêng, tương tự với view và controller (đã có sẵn folder cho controller) Chuột phải vào Project &gt; Add &gt; New Folder Tiếp tục chuột phải vào Folder Models &gt; Add &gt; Class, đặt tên class là TodoItem &gt; Ok Thêm 3 Property vô public string Key &#123; get; set; &#125; public string Name &#123; get; set; &#125; public bool IsComplete &#123; get; set; &#125; 3.3. Thêm Repository Repository, tiếng Việt là một chỗ lưu trữ cái gì đó, là một kỹ thuật mới tinh beng của ASP.NET core. Theo như tài liệu của họ, thì Repository dùng để đóng gói data, và chứa logic cho việc truy cập dữ liệu và chuyển nó qua cho Entity Model. Mặc dù app của chúng ta ko có database, nhưng mà cũng hay nếu như bạn hiểu cái đám code này hoạt động dư lào Để bắt đầu, chúng ta sẽ tạo một repository interface có tên ITodoRepository, dùng cách thêm class như trên, nhưng chọn template là Interface nhóe namespace todoapi.Models &#123; public interface ITodoRepository &#123; void Add(TodoItem item); IEnumerable&lt;TodoItem&gt; GetAll(); TodoItem Find(string key); TodoItem Remove(string key); void Update(TodoItem item); &#125; &#125; Cái interface này định nghĩa các phương thức CRUD (Create - Read – Update – Delete) Tiếp theo, ta thêm class TodoRepository, triển khai các phương thức trong Interface mới tạo bên trên public class TodoRepository : ITodoRepository &#123; private static ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, TodoItem&gt; _todos = new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, TodoItem&gt;(); public TodoRepository() &#123; Add(new TodoItem &#123; Name = &quot;Item1&quot; &#125;); &#125; public void Add(TodoItem item) &#123; item.Key = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); _todos[item.Key] = item; &#125; public IEnumerable&lt;TodoItem&gt; GetAll() &#123; return _todos.Values; &#125; public TodoItem Find(string key) &#123; TodoItem item; _todos.TryGetValue(key, out item); return item; &#125; public TodoItem Remove(string key) &#123; TodoItem item; _todos.TryGetValue(key, out item); _todos.TryRemove(key, out item); return item; &#125; public void Update(TodoItem item) &#123; _todos[item.Key] = item; &#125; &#125; Xong xuôi thì build nó phát để coi có lỗi gì hok Build xong nó lên dư lày là okie 3.4. Register cái Repository Bằng cách khai báo Interface repository, ta có thể tách biệt class repository ra khỏi controller xài nó. Thay vì tạo ra một instance của TodoRepository trong controller, ta có thể chọt cái ITodoRepository vào thẳng ASP.NET để sau này xài Depenency Injection (chưa biết nó là gì, tài liệu ở đây: https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/dependency-injection.html) Cách này giúp bạn dễ dàng viết Unit Test hơn. Test sẽ thu hẹp lại xuống logic của controller, chứ không test cái truy xuất dữ liệu. Để chọt (inject) nó vô controller, ta cần đăng ký nó. Mở file Startup.cs, thêm dòng sau vô đầu using todoapi.Models; Trong phương thức configureServices, thêm đoạn code sau vô cuối //Add our repository type services.AddSingleton&lt;ITodoRepository, TodoRepository&gt;(); 3.5. Thêm controller Chuột phải lên thư mục Controller &gt; Add &gt; New Item Chọn Web API Controller Class, đặt tên TodoController Xóa hết code trong class đi, thay bằng cái lày public class TodoController : Controller &#123; public ITodoRepository TodoItems &#123; get; set; &#125; public TodoController(ITodoRepository todoItems) &#123; TodoItems = todoItems; &#125; &#125; Như vậy là bạn đã khai báo một cái controller chả có gì bên trong cả. Trong các phần tiếp theo, chúng ta sẽ thêm các method để triển khai API nhóe. 3.6. Getting to-do items Thêm method sau vào TodoController public IEnumerable&lt;TodoItem&gt; GetAll() &#123; return TodoItems.GetAll(); &#125; [HttpGet(&quot;&#123;id&#125;&quot;, Name = &quot;GetToDo&quot;)] public IActionResult GetById(string id) &#123; var item = TodoItems.Find(id); if (item == null) &#123; return NotFound(); &#125; return new ObjectResult(item); &#125; Phương thức này có 2 cái get GET &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo GET &#x2F;api&#x2F;todo&#x2F;{id} Sau đây là một ví dụ cho HTTP Response khi gọi phương thức GetAll HTTP&#x2F;1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application&#x2F;json; charset&#x3D;utf-8 Server: Microsoft-IIS&#x2F;10.0 Date: Thu, 18 Jun 2015 20:51:10 GMT Content-Length: 82 [{“Key”:”4f67d7c5-a2a9-4aae-b030-16003dd829ae”,”Name”:”Item1”,”IsComplete”:false}] Sau này chúng ta sẽ dùng Fiddler để test các phương thức này nhóe 4. Routing và URL Paths Trong cái phương thức trên, bạn sẽ thấy có [HttpGet]. Cái này gọi là Attribute, và Attribute này dùng để chỉ định phương thức cho method bên dưới là Get. Đường dẫn Url thì được xây dựng như sau Lấy cái string trong Controller’s Route: [Route(“api&#x2F;[controller]”)] Bỏ cái [controller] ra, thay bằng tên của cái controller (tất nhiên là trừ đi chữ “Controller” nhóe). Ví dụ TodoController thì sẽ thay cái chữ Todo vô thôi Nếu mà HttpGet có template string, thì thêm cái string đó vô path. Cái ví dụ trên thì ko có Trong cái phương thức GetId bên trên, “{id}” là một giá trị giữ chỗ. Khi request lên, client sẽ xài cái Id của TodoItem thế vô đó. 5. Return values Phương thức GetAll trả về một kiểu dữ liệu là CLR Object. MVC tự động đổi nó thành JSON và viết JSON ra cái body của cái Reponse message. Reponse code sẽ là 200. Nếu có unhandled exception, reponse code sẽ là 5xx Nếu không có item nào có Id như răng, trả về reponse code 404. Cái này được định nghĩa bằng phương thức NotFound() 6. Triển thêm các phương thức CRUD khác 6.1. Create [HttpPost] public IActionResult Create([FromBody] TodoItem item) &#123; if (item == null) &#123; return BadRequest(); &#125; TodoItems.Add(item); return CreatedAtRoute(&quot;GetTodo&quot;, new &#123;id = item.Key&#125;, item); &#125; Phương thức Post [FromBody] cho phép MVC biết là cái TodoItem đó lấy từ body của request message Return CreatedAtRoute: sẽ trả về địa chỉ của cái item đấy luôn 6.2. Update [HttpPut(&quot;&#123;id&#125;&quot;)] public IActionResult Update(string id, [FromBody] TodoItem item) &#123; if (item == null || item.Key != id) &#123; return BadRequest(); &#125; var todo = TodoItems.Find(id); if (todo == null) &#123; return NotFound(); &#125; TodoItems.Update(item); return new NoContentResult(); &#125; Update cũng giống giống Create, nhưng mà xài HttpPut. Response chuẩn là 204 (No Content) Theo như tài liệu của HTTP, thì Put request đòi hỏi client phải gửi toàn bộ nội dung của item cần update, chứ không phải vài thông tin rời rạc. Để update chỉ 1 thông tin nào đó, dùng HttpPatch 6.3. Delete [HttpDelete(&quot;&#123;id&#125;&quot;)] public void Delete(string id) &#123; TodoItems.Remove(id); &#125; Void trả về response là 204 (No Content). Tức là client sẽ nhận được 204 kể cả khi Item đã bị delete hay item ko tồn tại Vậy là xong rồi, chờ bài post tiếp theo nhóe bạn","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"CSharp/ASP-NET","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/ASP-NET/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"C# string performance – Tips and Tricks","slug":"c-string-performance-tips-and-tricks","date":"2016-07-11T04:38:34.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.566Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/07/11/c-string-performance-tips-and-tricks/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2016/07/11/c-string-performance-tips-and-tricks/","excerpt":"Sau nhiều năm phát triển, C# trở thành một managed code vô cùng phổ biến và dễ sử dụng.

Ai ai cũng có thể học C#, và điều này làm nảy sinh ra nhiều thói quen tai hại ảnh hưởng tới hiệu suất của chương trình viết bằng C#. Chỉ cần search một phát, sẽ ra hàng tá kết quả khác nhau, với các lời khuyên khác nhau, đi kèm với các đoạn code bench mark khác nhau, vô cùng rối ren khiến ta bối rối. Tại sao vậy? Các vấn đề Sai lầm 1: Cộng chuỗi Sai lầm 2: check null – so sánh chuỗi rỗng Kết luận 1. Tại sao vậy?Rất đơn giản, là do các đoạn code bench mark này, mặc dù sử dụng cùng ngôn ngữ là C#, nhưng lại chạy trên các phiên bản .NET Framework khác nhau. Không cần đoán cũng biết rằng phiên bản càng về sau, compiler hoạt động càng hiệu quả, code bạn viết ra có hiệu suất càng cao. Thậm chí nó còn thông minh tới mức phát hiện ra các thói quen code xấu xí mà tự compile ra đoạn code hiệu quả nhất dùm bạn. Tuy nhiên, nói chung lại thì có một số vấn đề “trường tồn cùng thời gian” mà bạn có thể sẽ bắt gặp khi code một ứng dụng C# Bài viết này tập trung chủ yếu vào C# 6.0 đang được sử dụng cho các ứng dụng UWP của Windows 10 Project tham khảo có trong bài viết: https://github.com/huntertran/00-Multi-Utilities/tree/master/09%20-%20Test%20Peformance/TestPerformance 2. Các vấn đềString là một biến phức tạp của C#. Nếu như trong SQL, bạn khai báo varchar, nvarchar kèm theo một độ dài nhất định, thì trong C#, string có thể có độ dài cực lớn. Do đó, compiler sẽ rất là vất vả khi xử lý các biến string này. 2.1. Sai lầm 1: Cộng chuỗistring msg = &quot;Hello, &quot;; msg += &quot;Tuan Tran&quot;; msg += &quot;. Today is &quot;; msg += System.DateTime.Now.ToString(); Đoạn code trên quá bình thường, bình thường như cân đường hộp sữa. Tuy nhiên, đây sẽ là những gì mà compiler nhìn thấy string msg = &quot;Hello, &quot;; string tmp1 = new String( msg + &quot;Tuan Tran&quot; ); string msg = tmp1; // &quot;Hello &quot; is garbage. string tmp2 = new String( msg + &quot;. Today is &quot; ); msg = tmp2; // &quot;Hello Tuan Tran&quot; is garbage. string tmp3 = new String( msg + DateTime.Now.ToString( ) ); msg = tmp3; // &quot;Hello Tuan Tran. Today is &quot; is garbage. 2.1.1. Giải quyết: string.Concat, StringBuilder và string.FormatVề tổng quan, StringBuilder luôn là cái chạy nhay nhất. StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder(); s.Append(&quot;Tuan Tran&quot;); s.Append(&quot; Today is &quot;); blah blah blah Tuy nhiên, đối với C# 6.0 như đã đề cập bên trên, compiler của nó đủ thông minh để compile ra một đoạn native code hiệu quả nhất. Như vậy, nói tóm lại, bạn có thể sử dụng string.Concat để cộng các chuỗi đơn giản, StringBuilder để xây dựng các chuỗi bự hơn, và string.Format khi bạn muốn cộng các chuỗi từ các kiểu dữ liệu khác, hoặc muốn format nó theo một kiểu nào đó. 2.2. Sai lầm 2: check null – so sánh chuỗi rỗngQuá đơn giản phải Không? string s = &quot;&quot;; if(s == null || s == &quot;&quot;) &#123; //do something here; &#125; Có một cách khác hiện đại hơn string s = &quot;&quot;; if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(s)) &#123; //do something here; &#125; Và nếu bạn muốn so sánh 2 chuỗi với nhau, hãy sử dụng string.Equal 2.3. Kết luậnHãy bỏ thời gian tìm hiểu các method được viết sẵn cho string, và sử dụng chúng trong các tình huống phù hợp. Microsof đã viết sẵn cho bạn, và họ cũng đã tối ưu hiệu suất cho các method đó, tại sao lại Không xài chúng chứ.

Tất cả đều mang số hiệu 1.0 Vậy bạn tự hỏi, chúng nó là gì? 1. Giới thiệuXưa kia, khi muốn làm web, bạn có vô vàn lựa chọn: Nhanh, đơn giản, miễn phí: PHP, cài thêm PHP my assmin vô, cùng Apache Tomcat hay XAMPP gì gì đấy Bảo mật thì Java Server Page, bao chậm luôn Một số lựa chọn mới nổi như Node.js, vân vân Lựa chọn cuối cùng, vẫn là ASP.NET, vì nó đòi: Chạy trên Windows Server Code bằng .NET (C#) Ít host nào hỗ trợ (vì server tốn phí bản quyền) Hỗ trợ ít cơ sơ dữ liệu (SQL Server chả hạn) Với ASP.NET Core, bạn vẫn có các ưu điểm như code bằng C#, debug dễ dàng, IDE khủng, và các nhược điểm bị loại bỏ (chạy được trên Mac, Win, Linux, Docker, free to use, open source, blah blah blah) 2. Tài liệuXưa kia, muốn học ASP.NET, bạn có khá nhiều lựa chọn, mỗi cái đều có nhược điểm. Cái thì quá ít thông tin, cái thì tốn phí, cái thì sơ sài, và đa phần tản mát trong dân gian.

Tuy nhiên, theo phản ánh của khá nhiều developer tại Việt Nam, Store đang tiến hành xử trảm khá nhiều app tốt của dev VN và các nước khác. Vậy phải làm thế nào? Bài viết này cung cấp cho bạn những thông tin và các gợi ý để app của bạn mãi mãi nằm trên store, hiện trong search và leo lên tóp. 1. App của bạn, nội dung của bạn, hình ảnh của bạn, ý tưởng của bạn luônApp này do bạn tạo ra, và bạn sở hữu tất cả các nội dung có trong app đó, ví dụ như hình ảnh, nhạc, video, vân vân và vân vân. Việc trùng ý tưởng với một app khác cũng không quan trọng lắm trong vấn đề này, nhưng phải chắc chắn rằng app của bạn hay hơn app “con nhà người ta”, và con nhà người ta chưa đăng ký bản quyền cho cái ý tưởng đó. Ví dụ như bạn làm một app có tính năng quản lý Page trên facebook. Rồi bạn lấy cái logo facebook gắn vô. Có thể trước kia người xét duyệt app lên Store họ ko thèm để ý vấn đề này, nhưng ngày hôm nay đã khác rồi, app của bạn sẽ fail ngay và luôn. Và các app khác trên Store có trường hợp tương tự cũng sẽ bị gỡ bỏ. Một trường hợp khác, App của bạn bình thường, hình ảnh Free, nội dung hoàn toàn do bạn sáng tạo ra, nhưng cái tên lại có các từ dễ gây hiểu lầm. Đây là trường hợp mình gặp đối với 1 app của mình luôn. Đây là link tới App: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5zchk. Lúc đầu mình đặt tên app này là “Windows Universal Logo Maker”. Fail, fail và fail. Sau cùng, mình gửi message tới tester hỏi, và họ trả lời là chữ “Windows Universal” sẽ gây cho người dùng nhầm lẫn rằng app này là một app chính thức của Windows 10, do Microsoft phát hành, và họ cũng suggest mình đổi lại thành “Universal Logo Maker for Windows” -&gt; Pass ngay tắp lự. Một ghi chú nhỏ khác là không những tên app, mà tất cả các thông tin khác trong App description cũng phải mô tả tính năng của app đó, và không có các từ ngữ thuộc về các app nổi tiếng khác nhằm mục đích câu view, câu like, câu search cho app bạn. Có qua cũng phải có lại. Nếu app của bạn thực sự tốt, nội dung độc đáo, tạo ra giá trị hữu ích cho người dùng, dần dần app của bạn sẽ được xếp lên đầu các kết quả tìm kiếm, thậm chí chỉ cần gõ từ khóa là app sẽ hiện ra ngay dưới khung suggestion luôn. Khuyến cáo: Sử dụng app Universal Logo Maker for Windows để tạo ra bộ Icon cho App của bạn trong 5 nốt nhạc. 2. App hay và độc đáoCó hàng trăm ngàn app trên Store. Khi các chiêu trò câu view, câu like, câu search không còn tác dụng, thì bạn phải làm gì để người dùng tìm ra và download app của bạn? Câu trả lời đến từ logo, screenshot, và tính năng của app bạn. App đó càng đẹp, càng độc đáo, càng hữu ích cho người dùng, thì khả năng họ tìm ra nó cũng càng cao. Có một từ ngữ vui để gọi hiện tượng này, là “hiệu ứng trái banh tuyết”. App hay -&gt; người dùng xài nhiều -&gt; họ giới thiệu cho người khác -&gt; Review tích cực nhiều -&gt; lại càng dễ tìm trên Store -&gt; càng nhiều người dùng hơn Ví dụ, bạn làm một app Calculator chỉ với các tính năng cơ bản mà mấy cái app Calculator khác cũng có, thì 99% là sẽ chả có ai thèm để ý tới cái Calculator của bạn, bởi vì những cái app Calculator khác đang đứng đầu trên store và họ sẽ chọn những cái app đó. 3. Build 1 app hay thay vì build một chục app nhỏ tương tựVí dụ như bạn làm một game đua xe cho một chục thị trường khác nhau. Mỗi thị trường sẽ là một ngôn ngữ khác nhau. Điều này sẽ dễ dàng dẫn tới toàn bộ app giống giống nhau như thế fail một lượt. Thay vào đó, nếu bạn làm 1 app, với ngôn ngữ thay đổi tùy thuộc vào thị trường, thì app của bạn vẫn sẽ an toàn ở lại trên store, trong search, vân vân và vân vân. App nhỏ: Kết hợp lại thành app bự với tính năng chọn ngôn ngữ, hoặc lấy theo ngôn ngữ hiện tại của hệ điều hành 4. Giữ profile Windows Dev Center của bạn luôn luôn tốtĐiều cuối cùng mình muốn nhắn nhủ với các bạn Dev ngoài kia là hãy luôn cố gắng submit các app chất lượng cao lên Store. Trước khi làm một app gì, hãy search thử Store xem đã có app tương tự chưa để né tránh các trường hợp kể trên. Điều này giống như profile vay vốn ngân hàng vậy. Bạn càng “trong sạch” bao nhiêu, thì khả năng app của bạn lên top càng cao bấy nhiu. 5. Nếu app không lên Store sau khi submit thành côngCố gắng chờ thêm 24 tiếng nữa. App thường sẽ xuất hiện trên Store bằng cách nhấn vào direct link sau khi submit thành công khoảng 24 tiếng. Và mất khoảng 8-24 tiếng để có thể hiện lên trên kết quả search. Nếu chờ wài ko thấy lên, bạn có thể yêu cầu support tại: support ticket 6. Nếu app bị ẩn, chỉ có direct link, không search được trên StoreKiểm tra kỹ lại các gợi ý phía trên, đảm bảo rằng app của bạn không vi phạm bất kỳ điều gì, rùi gửi support ticket tại đây: support ticket. Bạn có thể yêu cầu họ giải thích chi tiết lý do tại sao (sử dụng ngôn từ lịch sự, nhã nhặn) 7. Promote appMột khi app đã lên, promote nó nhìu lên cho mọi người biết, download và đánh giá tốt cho nó. App của bạn sẽ càng nặng ký hơn khi có nhiều user từ các nước khác nhau ngoài Việt Nam Chúc app bạn lên Store suôn sẻ :D","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows 10","slug":"CSharp/Windows-10","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-10/"}],"tags":[{"name":"store","slug":"store","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/store/"},{"name":"hidden","slug":"hidden","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/hidden/"},{"name":"search","slug":"search","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/search/"},{"name":"windows","slug":"windows","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows/"}]},{"title":"[Windows] Implement In-App Purchase for Windows 10","slug":"windows-implement-in-app-purchase-for-windows-10","date":"2016-01-18T10:05:10.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.566Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/01/18/windows-implement-in-app-purchase-for-windows-10/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2016/01/18/windows-implement-in-app-purchase-for-windows-10/","excerpt":"Bạn có một app thặc là tuyệt zời ông mặt trời, tính năng độc đáo, hấp dẫn.

Mua In-App Purchase 3.4. Step 4: Change the test code to actual code 1. Official Documents Microsoft có tài liệu cho vụ này, thậm chí có cả sample code, nhưng nó sẽ không giúp ích được gì cho bạn. Tất cả đều khá chung chung, khơi khơi, mù mờ Enable In-App Purchase: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt219684.aspx Enable consumable in-app product purchases: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt219683.aspx Manage a large catalog of in-app products (Not really): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt219686.aspx Đọc từng câu từng chữ trong 3 cái tài liệu trên, tất cả những gì bạn có thể viết trong code là ít vô cùng. Hy vọng rằng trong tương lai điều này sẽ thay đổi. Giờ hãy thử theo cách khác nhóe 2. Keywords Phần này chứa các keywords mà bạn hay nhầm lẫn khi implement tính năng này Consumables: User có thể mua loại này bao nhiu tùy thích (tiu bỉu cho thể loại này là tiền trong game, quyền truy cập vào kho sách – nhạc – blah blah blah trong 6 tháng) Durables: User mua thể loại này một lần rồi là sẽ sở hữu nó mãi mãi. Ví dụ như level mới, màn chơi mới, vật phẩm ProductID: chính là ID của product của bạn. Đây sẽ là thông số đầu tiên khi tạo một In-App Purchase mới trên Dev Center 3. The Un-official (yet worked) ways 3.1. Step 1: Publish your app to the Store Việc đầu tiên bạn muốn làm sẽ là publish app của bạn lên Store. “Nhưng app vẫn đang trong giai đoạn dev, chưa publish được” – “App chưa có gì cả” – “App vẫn chưa hoàn thiện hết các tính năng” Không sao cả. Store cho phép bạn publish app của bạn, và ẩn khỏi ô tìm kiếm. Chỉ những ai có deep link (link dẫn trực tiếp tới app của bạn) mới có thể tải về và sử dụng. Như vậy bạn đã có thể ngăn chặn người dùng tìm ra app của bạn và tải nó về, tận hưởng những thứ đáng lẽ ra phải mua bằng Obama. Hide this app in the Store 3.2. Step 2: Create IAP (aka In-App Purchase) In-App Purchase hoàn toàn riêng biệt với app của bạn. Và cũng sẽ được xét duyệt như 1 app, nhưng thường chỉ mất khoảng 1 tiếng đồng hồ cho quá trình đó (quá chậm) Các bước tạo In-App Purchase, cũng như publish app, thì mỗi thời mỗi khác. Tóm lại là cứ làm theo hướng dẫn trên màn hình là được Tạo một In-App Purchase 3.3. Step 3: The tricky In-App Purchase sẽ ko chạy khi bạn có 1 trong các điều kiện sau In-App Purchase vừa mới tạo xong, chưa kịp lên đã lật đật đòi test Chưa có sản phẩm trên In-App Purchase trong Dev Center Bạn sẽ nghĩ: quá đơn giản, chỉ cần tạo sản phẩm trên In-App Purchase, chờ 1 tiếng đồng hồ để nó lên, sau đó vào lại app, chuyển sang chế độ Release là xong. Tuy nhiên Đặt Break-point ở các dòng code liên quan tới In-App Purchase sẽ không xem được data Dù đã có sản phẩm, nhưng vẫn ko liệt kê ra khi hiển thị lên màn hình (count &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) Và đây sẽ là cách. Lưu ý làm theo đúng thứ tự được trình bày trong blog này 3.3.1. Sử dụng CurrentAppSimulator Trong method khởi tạo hoặc load data cho app của bạn, đặt các dòng code sau StaticData.license = CurrentAppSimulator.LicenseInformation; StaticData.listings = await CurrentAppSimulator.LoadListingInformationAsync(); StaticData là một class chứa các biến Static, có thể truy cập ở mọi class khác Ngay sau khi chạy đoạn code này, Visual Studio sẽ tạo ra 1 file XML giả ở C:UsersAppDataLocalPackagesLocalStateMicrosoftWindows StoreApiDataWindowsStoreProxy.xml Bạn mở nó lên, và sửa các giá trị sau &lt;App&gt; &lt;IsActive&gt;true&lt;/IsActive&gt; &lt;IsTrial&gt;false&lt;/IsTrial&gt; &lt;/App&gt; Mục Product ID, sửa lại cho trùng với Product ID bạn đã đặt trên Dev Center 3.3.2. Hiện giá (và các thông tin khác) của sản phẩm Như bạn đã thấy rõ, StaticData.listings chứa toàn bộ In-App Purchase của bạn. Mọi sản phẩm đều có mặt trong này. Như vậy, để gắn giá lên một sản phẩm nào đó, ngoài việc có template, model ra, bạn sẽ cần phải chạy một vòng lặp foreach(KeyValuePair&lt;string, ProductListing&gt; productListing in StaticData.listings.ProductListings) &#123; if (productListing.Key.TrimStart(&#x27;0&#x27;) == issue.id) &#123; issue.billing.price = productListing.Value.FormattedPrice; &#125; &#125; Trong đoạn code trên, Product ID của mình là 0154, và issue.id là “154” FormattedPrice sẽ bao gồm cả đơn vị tiền tệ mà hệ thống đang sử dụng. Bạn cũng có thể đọc các thông tin khác như Description, Tag, vân vân và vân vân 3.3.3. Mua In-App Purchase Nhờ sự giúp đỡ của CurrentAppSimulator, bạn có thể test mua thoải mái. Chỉ cần chỉnh sửa các giá trị trong file WindowsStoreProxy.xml để test đi test lại Về cơ bản, đoạn code mua một vật phẩm bằng In-App Purchase sẽ như sau if (!StaticData.license.ProductLicenses[_selectedIssue.billing.iapKey].IsActive) &#123; try &#123; // Người dùng chưa từng mua cái này // Hiện hộp thoại mua await CurrentAppSimulator.RequestProductPurchaseAsync(_selectedIssue.billing.iapKey); //Kiểm tra lại xem đã mua thành công chưa if (StaticData.license.ProductLicenses[_selectedIssue.billing.iapKey].IsActive) &#123; // Nếu mua thành công thì làm trò mèo gì đó &#125; &#125; catch(Exception) &#123; // Mua bị lỗi // an error occurred. &#125; &#125; else &#123; // Đã mua cái này rồi, tiếp tục trò mèo &#125; Và khi test thử, lúc gọi đoạn code này, một hộp thoại nhỏ hiện ra, cho phép bạn giả lập các trường hợp có thể xảy ra khi dùng thật Có vẻ tốt rồi. Tới bước cuối cùng nhé 3.4. Step 4: Change the test code to actual code Step này khá đơn giản, chỉ cẩn thay tất cả những chỗ dùng CurrentAppSimulator thành CurrentApp là được. Và chạy lại app một lần nữa, lần này, khi bấm mua, sẽ có một hộp thoại thật hiện ra đòi bạn nhập mã PIN để tiến hành mua app. Tới bước này coi như là thành công Tips: Bạn nên submit In-App Purchase trên Dev Center trước 1-2 ngày để đảm bảo code thực sẽ chạy tốt (mình đã từng submit xong chờ 1 tiếng để nó lên, rồi chạy code thực thì lại báo là không có in-app purchase nào trên dev center &#x3D;.&#x3D;)","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows 10","slug":"CSharp/Windows-10","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-10/"},{"name":"Windows Store App","slug":"CSharp/Windows-10/Windows-Store-App","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-10/Windows-Store-App/"}],"tags":[{"name":"windows 10","slug":"windows-10","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-10/"},{"name":"iap","slug":"iap","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/iap/"},{"name":"in-app purchase","slug":"in-app-purchase","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/in-app-purchase/"},{"name":"monetization","slug":"monetization","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/monetization/"}]},{"title":"[Visual Studio Online] TFS love Slack, and vice versa","slug":"visual-studio-online-tfs-love-slack-and-vice-versa","date":"2016-01-17T16:57:07.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.566Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/01/17/visual-studio-online-tfs-love-slack-and-vice-versa/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2016/01/17/visual-studio-online-tfs-love-slack-and-vice-versa/","excerpt":"Bài viết này sẽ hướng dẫn bạn tích hợp TFS vào slack.

Đối với một số exception, Visual Studio sẽ bôi vàng đoạn code gây ra exception, nhưng đối với một số exception khác, Visual Studio lại nhảy hẳn ra ngoài. Vì sao vậy? Tại sao không cho tôi biết code chỗ nào bị lỗi. Visual Studio 2015 có một cải tiến đáng giá giúp lập trình viên biết chính xác chỗ code nào bị exception, và một số cải tiến vô cùng đáng giá khác khi debug một đoạn code 1. Advanced DebuggingTất cả mọi người đều biết, để debug một đoạn code, bạn thường đặt một break point. Khi code chạy tới đó, nó sẽ dừng ngay tại Breakpoint đó. The end. Hết phim. Tuy nhiên, nếu bạn đọc bài blog này: [Visual Studio] Performance, performance, performance (with the help of Visual Studio “PerfTips”), bạn sẽ thấy một công dụng nữa của Breakpoint dành cho việc đo đạc thời gian chạy một đoạn code. Ngoài ra, Breakpoint còn có một số công dụng khác nữa 1.1. Output Log with Breakpoint Trong vòng lặp trên, bạn sẽ thấy có dòng “Debug.WriteLine” dùng để xuất một thông tin gì đó ra màn hình Output. Thông tin này sẽ giúp bạn biết code đã chạy tới dòng này, và xuất ra các giá trị mà bạn mong muốn. Từ giờ, bạn không cần phải làm thủ công như vậy nữa. Đưa chuột lại gần Breakpoint, một menu nhỏ xíu hiện ra, nhấn vào dấu răng cưa Một cái cửa sổ hiện ra, chèn vào giữa đoạn code đặt breakpoint của bạn. Tick chọn ô Action. Bạn sẽ thấy tính năng “Log a message to output Windows” Gõ vào trong ô đó những thứ bạn muốn xuất ra cửa sổ output. Biến thì để trong dấu ngoặc nhọn. Thế là xong Khi chạy lại app, cửa sổ output sẽ là Bạn thấy con số nằm trong ngoặc kép là vì nó là kiểu string, không phải int. Nên khi hiển thị, Visual Studio sẽ đưa nó vào trong ngoặc kép Bây giờ, hãy so sánh một chút Breakpoint “Action” Debug.WriteLine() Lợi Nhanh chóng, đơn giảnKhông thay đổi codeCó thể chỉnh sửa khi ứng dụng đang chạyCó thể kết hợp với Condition của BreakpointCó thể quản lý tập trung trong cửa sổ Debug Sử dụng linh hoạtTrực quan, dễ hiểuCó thể chèn nhiều dòng Bất lợi Chỉ xuất ra được 1 dòng (mình chưa tìm được cách xuống dòng) Phải thay đổi codeKhông thể chỉnh sửa khi app đang chạyDùng Debug.WriteLineIf() để thêm điều kiệnMuốn tìm phải dùng Ctrl + F để tìm kiếm phrase như thông thườngGiảm hiệu suất (không đáng kể, và không ảnh hưởng khi Release) 1.2. Condition BreakpointTiếp tục tick chọn ô Condition, cửa sổ được mở rộng ra để lộ nhiều tùy chọn hơn cho bạn Bạn có nhiều tùy chọn để quyết định xem là Visual Studio có dừng lại ở Breakpoint này hay không. Trong số đó có Conditional Expression: Biểu thức điều kiện: Sẽ dừng ở breakpoint khi điều kiện đúng Hit Count: Số lần chạy qua: Cứ mỗi lần chạy qua breakpint này, Visual Studio sẽ tính là một hit. Khi đạt tới số lượng hit nhất định do bạn đặt thì sẽ dừng. Filter: Sẽ dừng ở Breakpoint khi một số điều kiện đặc biệt được thỏa mãn (ví dụ như MachineName, ProcessId, vân vân) Đối với App Windows, bạn sẽ cần dùng 2 cái đầu tiên nhiều nhất Giả sử mình muốn dừng lại ở lần chạy thứ 9, và xuất ra màn hình biến ở lần chạy này, thì thiết lập như sau: 2. The new Exception SettingsĐã bao giờ bạn gặp phải cái lỗi ở cái dòng lạ hoắc như vầy chưa? DISABLE_XAML_BREAK_ON_UNHANDLED_EXCEPTION Global::System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break(); Cái này là gì Hoặc lỗi như vầy “An exception of type “Blah blah blah” occurred in Yourappname.exe but was not handled in user code”, và kèm theo đó là Visual Studio dừng ở một dòng lạ hoắc, và bạn biết chắc chắn là lỗi xảy ra ở chỗ khác, không phải dòng này. Đó là lý do ta sẽ dùng Exception Setting để nhảy tới đúng chỗ code sinh ra lỗi Bạn vào Debug &gt; Windows &gt; Exception Settings… Copy tên của Exception, trong trường hợp trên là “System.Exception” và paste nó vào ô tìm kiếm. Tíck chọn kết quả hiện ra Chạy lại app. Và bây giờ, Visual Studio sẽ nhảy tới đúng dòng bị lỗi Quá tuyệt, phải không Đón xem các bài blog tiếp theo về các tính năng cực kute của Visual Studio nhé.","categories":[{"name":"uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/uncategorized/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"advanced","slug":"advanced","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/advanced/"},{"name":"bugs","slug":"bugs","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/bugs/"},{"name":"exception","slug":"exception","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/exception/"}]},{"title":"[UWP] Create image assets for your apps","slug":"uwp-create-image-assets-for-your-apps","date":"2015-10-26T05:01:01.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.566Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/10/26/uwp-create-image-assets-for-your-apps/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/uwp-create-image-assets-for-your-apps/","excerpt":"Windows 10 apps (aka Universal Windows App) yêu cầu rất nhiều kích thước hình ảnh khác nhau trong project của nó (hiện tại là 39 kích thước khác nhau).

Nó có thể tạo ra tất cả hình ảnh bạn cần, đặc biệt là cho Windows 10 package. Link: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5zchk Nhìn vô biết xài liền, nhưng mà dù sao cũng hướng dẫn bạn một tí nhóe. 2. Using it Nhìn hình trên là biết xài ngay phải hem. Bạn cũng có thể nghịch với các slider, nút này nọ để hiểu rõ hơn về app nhóe 3. Add custom size and scaleNhấn cái nút dấu + nhỏ nhỏ Trong trang này, bạn có thể thêm các size mới của riêng mình Platform name is the name of your custom collection. By this way, you can create many platforms that match your need, and choose to generate images for these custom platform or not. Platform name là tên của danh sách những cái kích thước khác nhau của bạn. Bằng cách này, bạn có thể tạo bao nhiêu platforms cũng được. Nên đặt tên khác nhau cho dễ nhớ. Cái text box bự bự bên dưới là chỗ bạn nhập các thông số kích thước. Giải thích cú pháp: Mỗi thông số cách nhau bởi dấu “:”. Đầu tiên là tên, rồi rộng, rồi cao. Dễ ẹt mà. Khi bạn đang gõ, nếu đúng, nó sẽ preview trước cho bạn xem cái kích thước sẽ được add vào platform đó Làm xong rồi thì nhấn Add, cái kích thước đó sẽ nằm trong platform, và platform mới sẽ được thêm vào danh sách các platform. Cái hay ho nhứt là, dần dần, danh sách các platform do bạn tạo ra sẽ được đồng bộ hóa giữa tất cả thiết bị mà bạn login bằng cùng tài khoản Microsoft Account. Kiểu như trên công ty tạo ra xài xong, về nhà mở máy lên là đã có sẵn để xài tiếp. 4. SettingsTrong setting, có cũng nhìu tùy chọn. Chọn chỗ lưu, về app này, feedback, blah blah blah. Cái hay nhất là “Update Database” Bình thường, app sẽ update database tự động. Nhưng vì lý do nào đó (kiểu như bạn đang xài dữ liệu 3g, hay PC đang connect tới mạng chập chờn chả hạn), bạn có thể check update bằng tay. Cái này chỉ update cái danh sách platform default, không phải cái custom do bạn tự tạo, nên hok sao âu. 5. Rate for me, please, and feedbackCuối cùng, nếu bạn thấy app này hữu ích, rate cho nó nhá.

Vì vậy, bạn sẽ luôn có những đoạn code mới nhất, do chính mấy ông kỹ sư viết ra tính năng đó viết. Quá chuẩn? Sau đây là cách lấy code. 1. A really good Git Source Control softwareVì tất cả code đều nằm trên GitHub, nên bạn sễ cần một phần mềm Source Control tốt để: Download tất cả code Update code với 1 click Xem phiên bản code và tên của từng phiên bản Nếu bạn quyết định ko xài phần mềm Source Control, bạn vẫn có thể download toàn bộ code dưới dạng file .zip, rồi extract nó ra và xài như hồi xưa. Vậy cái nào tốt? Of course it’s your choice. Use whatever you’re familiar with. Don’t let me tell you what to do. But if you insisted, here they are Tất nhiên là lựa chọn của bạn. Xài cái nào thấy wen là được. Nhưng mà vẫn muốn biết một cái tốt (theo ý mình), thì đọc tiếp nhé. 1.1. GitHub Desktop – Not that goodLink: https://desktop.github.com/ GitHub Desktop, phát triển bới chính dòng họ nhà mều bạch tuộc GitHub, chả tốt tẹo nào. Vì sao áh? Vì nó quá đơn giản, và thiếu nhiều nút cơ bản như Pull, Push, Fetch, Sync, blah blah blah. GitHub Desktop mong muốn mọi thứ đơn giản nhất có thể. Nhưng họ lại bỏ hết mấy từ quen thuộc trong Git rồi. 1.2. SourceTree – More complex, have all the functionsMy favorite: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ SourceTree, phát triển bởi Atlassian, là một phần mềm git source control khá tốt (theo ý cá nhân). Bạn có thể làm mọi thứ bạn muốn với nó. Thậm chí nó còn có cả Command Lind cho ai thích gõ lệnh như hacker nhé. 2. Setting up Giờ, có thể bạn đã nghe thiên hạ đồn là Microsoft mở mã nguồn bộ .NET. Thực ra thì thiên hạ đồn quả nhiên ko sai, mà còn thiếu. Không chỉ .NET không, mà còn khá nhiều thứ khác cũng được “mở”. Nói bạn rồi, Microsoft đã chịu chơi trở lại. Bạn có thể tìm thấy kha khá thứ hay ho ở link sau: https://github.com/Microsoft Để thiếp lập, bạn sẽ cần tới “clone link”, là 1 trong 3 cái bên dưới. Chọn HTTPS cho nó đơn giản HTTPS: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples.git SSH: git@github.com:Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples.git Subversion: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples Mở SourceTree (hoặc phần mềm mà bạn thích) &gt; Clone&#x2F;New Copy &#x2F; Paste cái link HTTPS vô “Source Path &#x2F; URL”, và SourceTree sẽ tự động điền mấy chỗ khác. Nếu bạn muốn customize cái gì thì cứ thoải mái chọt zô mà sửa đổi. Cuối cùng, click Clone. Thế là xong, tất cả code Sample đã nằm trên máy tính. 3. Keep the code up-to-dateGiờ bạn đã có code rồi, làm gì nữa? Để update code, đơn giản là mở SourceTree lên, rồi nhấn Fetch &gt; Pull hoặc nhấn Sync luôn từ đầu.

Bài post này sẽ hướng dẫn bạn cách sử dụng những công cụ mới của Visual Studio 2015 để cải thiện hiệu suất cho ứng dụng của bạn. 1. Tại sao lại là hiệu suất?Trong Visual Studio 2015 có khá nhiều công cụ giúp bạn cải thiện hiệu suất ứng dụng của mình, làm nó chạy nhanh hơn, chiếm ít bộ nhớ hơn, giao diện đẹp hơn, blah blah blah. Tuy nhiên, rất nhìu bạn trẻ dùng phần lớn thời gian để làm cho các tính năng của ứng dụng chạy đúng như bạn mong muốn. Bạn hiểu rằng đoạn code bạn viết có performance không cao, nhưng bạn không có thời gian để nghiên cứu, nghiền ngẫm nó hoặc chạy các công cụ hỗ trợ phân tích hiệu suất cho tới khi hiệu suất là một vấn đề lớn của bạn. Ngoài ra, khi bạn cần nghiên cứu hiệu suất của một đoạn code nào đó, vì sức mạnh kinh khủng của Visual Studio, bạn lại nhét vào code của mình một cái Stopwatch để đo xem đoạn code đó chạy mất bao lâu. Nói tóm lại, developer thường làm những chuyện sau: Chèn code vào trong ứng dụng (kiểu như System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch) để đo thời gian chạy. Càng lúc càng nhiều Stopwatch được chèn đi chèn lại trong nhiều khúc của code. Debug từng dòng code một để xem thử có dòng nào “chạy lâu” wá không Nhấn “Break All” (“Pause”) để coi thử code chạy tới đâu gòi (đặc biệt là trong mấy vòng lặp) Rút gọn code quá đà mà không để ý tới performance (giống như không xài Linq cho tất cả mọi thứ) 2. PerfTips là gì?Khi bạn đặt breakpoint cho một dòng code nào đó, và app chạy tới breakpoint này, Visual Studio sẽ hiện một đoạn chữ nhỏ nhỏ, mờ mờ ngay cuối dòng, và nó chính là PerfTips Bấm vào nó (chỗ &lt;&#x3D; 1ms elapsed), sẽ hiện ra công cụ phân tích 3. Dùng PerfTipsChúng ta sẽ sử dụng một sample đơn giản, một đoạn code dùng để load hình Thay vì chèn 2 đoạn code Stopwatch vào đầu và cuối của phương thức này, bạn chỉ cần đặt 2 breakpoint vào chỗ đó Nhấn F5 để chạy, và Visual Studio dừng lại ngay chỗ Breakpoint đầu tiên Nhấn F5 (hoặc continue) để Visual Studio chạy tiếp tới breakpoint thứ 2, và bạn sẽ thấy PerfTips hiện ra Như vậy ta có thể thấy, method LoadImages chạy mất 2780 milisecond. Bây giờ chạy lại toàn bộ một lần nữa, nhưng dừng lại ở từng dòng code một để xem dòng nào tốn nhiều thời gian nhất. Nhấn F10 để chạy từng dòng code một. Vài dòng đầu tiên, mỗi dòng không quá 20 ms, quá tốt. Thế như tới dòng GetImageFromCloud tốn tới 1391 ms Và dòng LoadImagesFromDisk tốn tới 1361 ms Vậy tại sao ta không cho 2 method này chạy song song với nhau nhỉ? Đổi code thành như sau Trong hình trên, bạn có thể thấy cả method LoadImages chạy mất 2079 ms, giảm cỡ 700 ms, tương đương 25%. Quá tuyệt phải không? Bây giờ, khi bạn đã biết cách xài PerfTips, chúng ta sẽ tiếp tục với một vài Best Practices khi dùng nó 4. Best Practices4.1. Đo nhiều lầnThời gian chạy, hiệu suất code có thể khác nhau cho mỗi lần chạy. Thông thường một đoạn code chạy lần đầu tiên lúc nào cũng chậm hơn khi chạy lần 2, 3, n. Lý do là ở lần đầu tiên, nó phải load các dll, khởi tạo bộ nhớ đệm. Đo nhiều lần sẽ cho bạn một khoảng thời gian chính xác hơn 4.2. Xác nhận lại lúc ReleaseCode chạy lúc build ở chế độ Debug lúc nào cũng chậm hơn hẳn so với code build ở chế độ Release. Nếu bạn muốn tối ưu hóa các đoạn code chạy nhanh hơn 50 ms, thì nên chuyển sang chế độ release để tối ưu hóa nó. Lúc này, bạn mới thấy rõ sự khác biệt. Thế là xong.

Nó có thể là App Windows 8, 8.1, Windows Universal App, hoặc Universal Windows Platform (UWP, aka App phát triển cho Windows 10) Build và chạy thử app, sau đó quay lại Visual Studio, bạn sẽ thấy một cục toolbar nhỏ gọi là “Live Visual Tree”. Nhấn zô nó để mở ra Nhấn vô nút hình cái ghim nhỏ nhỏ để dính nó zô đó, dễ xài hơn Trong cửa sổ này, click vào biểu tượng hình tam giác trỏ trỏ vô cái hình chữ nhật nho nhỏ. Đó chính là Inspector, rất giống với Element Inspector của Google Chrome. Quay lại app đang chạy, bạn sẽ thấy con trỏ đi tới đâu, một cái khối hộp chữ nhật viền chấm đỏ bao xung quanh element bên dưới con trỏ. Click một phát, và Live Visual Tree sẽ nhảy tới vị trí chính xác của element đó Bạn cũng có thể click vào các elements khác trong Live Visual Tree, và cái khung chấm đỏ sẽ nhảy tới element trên app đang chạy của bạn. Bằng cách này, bạn có thể hiểu chính xác những element nào được vẽ trên app của bạn. Bạn cũng có thể search một element bằng tên hoặc loại của nó 2. Live Property ExplorerVới một element bất kỳ được chọn trong Live Visual Tree, nhìn wa bên phải của Visual Studio, bạn sẽ thấy “Live Property Explorer”, click vô nó để mở ra, rùi click cái ghim để đó dính zô đó Ủa mà sao có ít propery hơn bình thường nhỉ. Đừng lo, mở rộng cái group “Default” ra và bạn sẽ thấy mấy property còn lại” Một điều hay của Live Property Explorer là bạn có thể thay đổi các giá trị trong các property, và xem sự thay đổi đó ngay lập tức trên app đang chạy của bạn. Mình sẽ thử đổi Height thành 100, và xem chuyện gì sẽ xảy ra trong app Giờ tới cái app Quá kinh khủng phải ko? Bạn có thể thay đổi hầu như mọi thứ, ngoại trừ một số property bị khóa (màu xám xịt) trong Live Property Explorer Quá đã. Thế là bây giờ bạn đã biết sử dụng Live Visual Tree để dò code XAML của bạn được render như thế nào trên app, và dùng Live Property Explorer để thay đổi giá trị của các Property, và xem sự thay đổi đó ngay lập tức, ngay trên app đang chạy mà không cần phải build lại.

Visual Studio có sức mạnh siu nhơn, và sau đây là lý do mà tôi nói nó có. Bài viết này bao gồm các thủ thuật, tiện ích và hướng dẫn sử dụng những tính năng cực hay ho nhưng khá ít người biết tới của Visual Studio. 1. Super Power 1: JetBrains ReSharperReSharper là một extension cực khủng của JetBrains. Nó sẽ đảm nhiệm vai trò dọn dẹp, trang điểm cho code của bạn đẹp như thơ, tăng hiệu suất làm việc, tăng khả năng maintenance, tăng tính tái sử dụng code vào nhiều project khác nhau. Bạn chưa tin ư, hãy xem phần 1.4. Các tính năng 1.1. Nếu bạn là sinh viênJetBrains ReSharper miễn phí cho sinh viên (họ còn miễn phí toàn bộ các sản phẩm khác nữa). Tuy nhiên, chương trình miễn phí này được giấu khá kỹ trên trang chủ của nó. Truy cập vào link sau: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ Nhấn Apply Now ở khúc dưới Bạn có nhiều tùy chọn chứng minh mình là sinh viên. Cách dễ nhất: dùng email đuôi .edu Ngoài ra còn có thể dùng thẻ sinh viên quốc tế hoặc giấy tờ chứng minh (lâu hơn một chút) Một email gửi tới cho bạn, hướng dẫn cách thực hiện tiếp theo 1.3. Cài đặtSau khi đã có license, bạn tiến hành cài đặt nó. File cài đặt khoảng hơn 100 MB. Tắt Visual Studio trước khi cài. Sau khi cài xong, mở Visual Studio lên, và bạn sẽ thấy có nhiều khác biệt 1.4. Các tính năng tuyệt zời1.4.1. Phân tích codeKhi mở một file .cs lên, ReSharper sẽ tự động phân tích code có trong file này và đưa ra các đề xuất hợp lý. Nhìn bên phải, bạn sẽ thấy thanh cuộn mặc định được “tô điểm” bởi các vạch màu vàng đỏ xanh tùm lum. Đó là các điểm đánh dấu code “có vấn đề”. Những vạch dọc: Màu xanh lá cây: Những đoạn code đã được lưu Màu vàng: Những đoạn code vừa mới chỉnh sửa hoặc thêm mới, chưa lưu Những vạch ngang: Màu cam: code bị thừa Màu đỏ: code lỗi Màu xanh lá cây: code có thể rút gọn 1.4.2. Xóa code thừaClick chuột vào một trong các vạch màu cam Con trỏ sẽ nhảy tới ngay vị trí code đang có vấn đề Bấm vào hình cái bóng đèn &gt; Chọn dòng đầu tiên để sửa lỗi (đối với đa số trường hợp, dòng gợi ý đầu tiên là dòng gợi ý hợp lý nhất) Như hình trên, khai báo “this.” bị thừa. ReSharper sẽ giúp bạn loại bỏ chữ “this” bị thừa này. Bạn cũng có thể thực hiện việc xóa bỏ này hàng loạt. Nhấn dấu mũi tên nhỏ bên cạnh dòng đầu tiên để thấy nhiều tùy chọn hơn. Bạn cũng có thể thử dòng gợi ý thứ 2: Xóa bỏ toàn bộ code thừa trong file này. Bạn có thể bấm dấu mũi tên bên cạnh để thấy nhiều tùy chọn hơn Visual Studio từ phiên bản 2015 cũng có một vài gợi ý tương tự. Trỏ chuột vào hình bóng đèn sát bên dưới code &gt; Show potential fixes Cá nhân mình thấy cách làm của ReSharper hiện đại hơn, dễ nhìn hơn. 1.4.3. Code đúng chuẩnReSharper giúp bạn code theo đúng chuẩn, thu gọn code, thay thế bằng các đoạn code dễ hiểu hơn, vân vân và vân 1.4.4. Tự hoàn thành code khi đang gõGiả sử bạn muốn khai báo một biến string, kiểu private. Bạn chỉ cần gõ như hình dưới rồi nhấn “;” Bạn muốn sử dụng một method nào đó mà chưa khai báo namespace. Đối với Visual Studio, bạn sẽ phải gõ đầy đủ tên method. Sau đó phải click chuột vài lần thì Visual mới tự thêm namespace cho bạn. Đối với ReSharper, bạn chỉ cần gõ một phần của tên method. Khi method đó đã được tô sáng lên trong danh sách gợi ý, bạn chỉ cần gõ một trong các ký tự đặc biệt như dấu chấm, khoảng trắng, enter là mọi việc còn lại sẽ được hoàn tất. 1.4.5. Thu gọn codeNhấn vào một vạch ngang xanh lá cây bất kỳ trên thanh cuộn. Con trỏ sẽ nhảy tới dòng code có thể rút gọn. Những đoạn code có thể rút gọn được gạch chân màu xanh lá cây. Click chuột vào đó &gt; Click cái bóng đèn &gt; Chọn dòng gợi ý đầu tiên Kết quả 1.4.6. Tự sinh codeTạo một model mới như hình sau Khai báo Interface cho nó là “INotifyPropertyChanged” (chỉ cần gõ “INotiyPr” rồi enter là xong) Sau khi nhấn enter, rõ rang model đã bị thiếu nhìu thứ quan trọng của INotifyPropertyChanged. Nhấn chuột vào cái bóng đèn màu đỏ &gt; Implement INotifyPropertyChanged Và kết quả (trong lần thực hiện đầu tiên, ReSharper sẽ hỏi bạn cho phép nó thêm một số file vào thư mục Properties. Cứ cho phép nó nhé) 1.4.7. Code GenerationSử dụng TestModel, bạn hãy thêm vào vài biến lấy lệ để test tính năng Code Generation Bạn vào menu ReSharper &gt; Edit &gt; Generate Code… (Menu này nằm ngang hàng với File – Edit – View - …) Một ô nhỏ hiện ra, bạn chọn Properties Bạn chọn tất cả các trường muốn tạo Property &gt; Tick luôn khai báo Notify On Property Changed (để tiện cho mô hình MVVM) rồi nhấn Finish Kết quả: Thật tuyệt phải ko? 1.4.8. Đổi tên class – method – Hàm, vân vân và vân vânReSharper hỗ trợ bạn đổi tên bất kỳ thứ gì, và tên được đổi đó sẽ được thay đổi ở tất cả các file có sử dụng nó. Giả sử class TestModel này được sử dụng ở 3 file, và bạn muốn đổi tên nó thành NotTestModel, thì cả 3 file kia sẽ được cập nhật tên mới. Đưa con trỏ chuột vào tên class TestModel Chọn Menu ReSharper &gt; Refactor &gt; Rename… Một hộp thoại nhỏ hiện ra Sửa tên lại. Nếu bạn muốn có tính năng Undo, tick chọn bên dưới rồi Next 1.4.9. Đưa string vào ResourceBạn này làm app có Localization (aka: dịch các string trong app ra các ngôn ngữ khác nhau cho các thị trường khác nhau), hẳn là sẽ rất khổ sở khi phải đưa từng string từng string một vào Resource để dịch. Có bạn áp dụng phương pháp cuốn chiếu, làm tới đâu thêm string vào Resource tới đó. File Resource lúc nào cũng mở sẵn. Có bạn chọn cách làm xong app rồi mới đưa từng string một vào Resource bằng cách Copy &gt; Paste rất thủ công Và anh hùng ReSharper xuất hiện. Để đưa một đoạn string vào Resource, bạn đưa con trỏ chuột vào string đó, chọn menu ReSharper &gt; Refactor &gt; Move… Một hộp thoại nhỏ hiện ra. Tại đây bạn có thể lựa chọn, thay đổi các thông số Nhấn Next và chiêm ngưỡng thành quả Tuy nhiên, Method GetValue này đã lỗi thời rồi, phải sửa nó một chút như hình sau tính năng này cũng dùng được cho các đoạn string trong code XAML nhé ReSharper còn hàng hàng tính năng khác chờ bạn khám phá 2. Super Power 2: XAML StylerCó khi nào bạn cảm thấy khó chịu khi code giao diện bằng XAML, và các thuộc tính cứ nằm luôn tuồn trên một hàng, kéo wá kéo lại quá vất vả? Có khi nào bạn nhìn đống code XAML, và chẳng biết phải tìm thuộc tính mình cần ở đâu? XAML Styler đã đến. Và nó sẽ giúp bạn format code XAML tuyệt đẹp. 2.1. Cài đặtVào Menu Tools &gt; Extension and Updates… Tiếp tục chọn mục Online &gt; Visual Studio Gallery &gt; Nhập “XAML Styler” vào ô tìm kiếm và cài đặt XAML Styler 2.2. Thiết lập thuộc tínhVào menu Tools &gt; Option &gt; kéo xuống dưới cùng chọn XAML Styler Chỉnh các thuộc tính như hình Chắc các bạn thắc mắc tại sao lại phải chỉnh như vậy :3. Đó là theo kinh nghiệm cá nhân của mình để tăng hiệu suất và giảm sai sót thôi. 2.3. Sử dụngSử dụng rất đơn giản: bạn mở code XAML lên &gt; click chuột phải &gt; Format XAML Before After 3. Super Power 3: Indent Guide và C# Outline3.1. Indent GuideQua hình chụp screenshot nãy giờ, chắc các bạn cũng thắc mắc các đường kẻ dọc trong screenshot có mà Visual Studio của bạn không có? Đó chính là Indent Guide Extension. Chức năng của nó rất đơn giản, vẽ ra các đường kẻ dọc để code bạn dễ nhìn hơn, canh theo đúng hàng đúng lối. Ngay khi cài xong, khởi động lại Visual Studio, mở một Project bất kỳ và bạn sẽ thấy thành quả 3.2. C# OutlineNhìn hình trên, chắc bạn cũng thấy lạ là tại sao cấu trúc if cũng có một dấu “-“ nho nhỏ để đóng ra mở vô. Đó chính là khả năng của Extension C# Outline. C# Outline giúp bạn tạo một code block ở mọi dấu ngoặc nhọn. Như vậy bạn có thể đóng mở tất cả các cấu trúc khác nhau như If then else, while do, switch case, vân vân và vân vân tên chính thức của nó là C# outline 2015, dành cho Visual Studio 2015 nhé bạn Hết gòi, hẹn gặp lại bạn ở bài sau","categories":[{"name":"uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/uncategorized/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Visual-Studio/"},{"name":"app","slug":"app","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/app/"},{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/CSharp/"},{"name":"hero","slug":"hero","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/hero/"},{"name":"indent","slug":"indent","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/indent/"},{"name":"resharper","slug":"resharper","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/resharper/"}]},{"title":"[Azure] [Vietnamese] Đăng ký Azure - Hướng dẫn từng bước","slug":"azure-vietnamese-dang-ky-azure-huong-dan-tung-buoc","date":"2015-08-13T07:34:23.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.565Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/08/13/azure-vietnamese-dang-ky-azure-huong-dan-tung-buoc/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2015/08/13/azure-vietnamese-dang-ky-azure-huong-dan-tung-buoc/","excerpt":"Azure đã tới Việt Nam, và bạn đang phân vân không biết phải đăng ký như thế nào để sử dụng nó, hoàn toàn miễn phí?

Hello guys, from this post forward, I will write in English. You can use “Google Translate” or “Bing Translate” to read it in Vietnamese In the latest release of Visual Studio (aka Visual Studio 2015), Microsoft has introduced some cutting-edge features called “Live Visual Tree” and “Live Property Explorer.” You can easily inspect and edit your XAML element on the fly using these features. Live Visual TreeFor using Live Visual Tree, open any XAML project. It could be Windows 8, 8.1 App, Windows Universal App, or Universal Application Platform (UAP, aka App, developed for Windows 10) Press Build (F5) to compile and deploy the app. Then come back to Visual Studio. You will see a new small toolbar called “Live Visual Tree.” Click on it to expand Now click on the small docking icon to make it stick there, make it easier to use Now, click on the small icon that has the small triangle pointed to a rectangle in this window. This is the Inspector, just like Google Chrome element inspector. Comeback to running app, you will see wherever the pointer is, there will be a dotted box around it, cover the element under the pointer Click once, and the Live Visual Tree will jump to the same element. You can click on other elements in the Live Visual Tree, and the red dotted box will jump to that element on your running app. In this way, you can see exactly how the element is drawn on your app. You can also search for an element by its name or by type. Live Property ExplorerWith the element selected in Live Visual Tree, look on the right side of Visual Studio. You will see “Live Property Explorer.” Click on it to expand and click the “dock” button to make it stick there Now it has a lot fewer properties than usual, right? Expand the “Default” group, and you will see the rest. The good thing about this Live Property Explorer is, you can actually change the value and observe the change in your running app I will try to change the Height to 100 and see what happened on the app And now the app Incredible, isn’t it? You can change almost everything, except some grey-out property in the Live Property Explorer. That’s it. Now you know how to use the Live Visual Tree to inspect the XAML element on your apps, and Live Property Explorer to change the value of that element, and watch the change happen on the fly.

Có một số add-on chỉ có Firefox mới có, và ngược lại Các addon nâng cao NoScript – Firefox only Thiết lập Sử dụng Blacklist một đoạn Script Tips and Tricks Lợi và hại uBlock – Firefox và Chrome Các addon nâng caoNoScript – Firefox onlyMột website được hiển thị trên màn hình của bạn dựa trên 3 yếu tố: HTML, CSS và JavaScript. HTML sẽ chứa nội dung, CSS sẽ định dạng cho nội dung đó (canh chỉnh lề, màu sắc, kích thước) và JavaScript sẽ chịu trách nhiệm tính toán, hiệu ứng, tất tần tật mọi thứ khác. Vấn đề nằm ở chỗ, khi load một website, không phải đoạn Script nào cũng cần thiết để web hoạt động, có các đoạn Script hoàn toàn không liên quan như theo dõi hành vi người dùng, tải quảng cáo, phân tích dữ liệu cho các bộ máy tìm kiếm. Đó là lý do NoScript ra đời Theo mặc định, NoScript sẽ chặn tất cả, và chỉ chừa lại các đoạn Script bạn cho nó chạy mà thôi. Tải tại đây: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/noscript/ Sau khi cài đặt, đây sẽ là hình ảnh các bạn nhận được khi mở bất kỳ trang web nào, khá khó chịu phải ko? Thiết lậpĐể thiết lập cho NoScript, click chuột vào nó và chọn Option Chọn thẻ Notification để bỏ dòng thông báo xuất hiện bên dưới trình duyệt Bỏ chọn các dòng được đánh dấu bằng mũi tên Vậy là xong bước thiết lập Sử dụngQuay trở lại google, khi vào google, bạn sẽ không còn thấy thanh thông báo script đã bị chặn nữa. Thử tìm kiếm một từ khóa nào đó, bạn sẽ thấy có nhiều hiện tượng lạ khác với google bình thường Đầu tiên là google quay trở về cái giao diện cổ xưa cũ rích Tính năng Instant Search cũng mất luôn. Chuyện gì đang xảy ra? Đơn giản là bạn đang chặn toàn bộ JavaScript của google, và đây là tất cả những gì mà Google có thể làm được khi thiếu JavaScript Để cho phép JavaScript của google hoạt động, rê chuột lên biểu tượng của NoScript Và chọn Allow google.com Thế là google tự động reload, và giao diện quen thuộc đã quay trở lại Biểu tượng NoScript giờ biến thành chữ S, nhưng vẫn có một dấu chặn đỏ nho nhỏ bên dưới. Đó là vì vẫn còn Script bị chặn, bạn nên rê chuột lên để kiểm tra thử Vẫn còn 1 Script là gstatic.com đang bị chặn. Bạn có muốn cho phép nó hay ko là tùy bạn. Nên nhớ, một số đoạn Script cần thiết phải cho phép để website hoạt động đúng như những gì nó được sinh ra để làm Một ví dụ khác. Trang http://news.zing.vn/ Ở trang này, lúc đầu cũng như google, tuy nhiên, khi rê chuột lên icon noscript, bạn sẽ thấy điều khác biệt Đoạn Script gì đây? Adtimaserver.vn là gì? Đầu tiên hãy cho phép zing.vn Trang news.zing.vn hiện ra đẹp đẽ, nhưng nhìn có vẻ hơi trống trải. Bạn tự hỏi những chỗ trống đó là gì? Bây giờ hãy tiếp tục cho phép adtimaserverv.vn và cảm nhận điều khác biệt Bắt đầu lag, quảng cáo tràn ngập khắp mọi nơi. Và đó chính là chức năng của đoạn Script đó. Nếu bạn để ý, sẽ thấy ngoài 2 script ban đầu, còn rất nhiều script khác được chêm vô. Điều đó không có gì ngạc nhiên, một đoạn JavaScript có thể gọi thêm nhiều đoạn JavaScript khác hỗ trợ cho nó. Như vậy, quyết định cho đoạn Script nào chạy, đoạn nào không là ở bạn. Blacklist một đoạn ScriptSau khi biết chắc một đoạn script nào đấy chỉ dành cho quảng cáo, hoặc chỉ dùng để theo dõi người dùng, bạn có thể đưa nó vào blacklist ngay và luôn để từ lần sau, NoScript sẽ chặn nó mà không hỏi ý kiến bạn nữa Đưa chuột vào Icon NoScript, chọn Untrusted &gt; chọn đoạn script muốn blacklist Cẩn thận không blacklist nhầm các đoạn script quan trọng nhé Sau cùng, khi toàn bộ script trên một trang web đã được xử lý (cho phép hoặc bị đưa vào blacklist), biểu tượng NoScript sẽ biến thành như này Tips and Tricks Để tạm thời cho phép toàn bộ script của một trang, bạn có thể chọn Temporarily allow all on this page Trong một số trường hợp, trang web bị redirect (aka: chuyển qua một trang khác) quá nhanh trước khi bạn kịp “Allow” một đoạn script của trang đó, bạn có thể sử dụng tính năng “Recently Blocked Script” để cho phép các đoạn script bị block gần đây. Bạn có thể Export &#x2F; Import toàn bộ thiết lập của NoScript trong option của nó Một số trang web không cho bạn blacklist các JavaScript của nó bằng một thủ thuật tinh vi là steal focus, làm cho bạn không thể nào click được Untrust. Bấm F12, chọn thẻ Debugging &gt; Bấm vào nút pause (có hình 2 cái vạch giống vầy || ), là bạn có thể untrust các đoạn script của nó Gõ about:config trên trình duyệt, tìm noscript.untrusted để xem toàn bộ các script đang bị blacklist. Bạn có thể copy danh sách này và paste nó cho bạn bè của mình.

Bài viết này sẽ hướng dẫn các bạn cách thiết lập cho các trình duyệt phổ biến để chúng chạy trơn tru mượt mà mà không chói lóa. 1. Thiết lập cho máy tính 1.1 Quay về thiết lập mặc định 1.2 Gỡ bỏ các trình duyệt không chính thống 1.3 Cài đặt một trình duyệt Web chính chủ 1.3.1 Mozilla Firefox 1.3.2 Google Chrome 2. Tối ưu hóa trình duyệt web 2.1 Mozilla Firefox 2.1.1 Về thiết lập mặc định 2.1.2 Gỡ bỏ các Add-on – Plug-in vớ vẩn 2.1.3 Cài các Add-on hữu ích 2.1.3.1 Color that site 2.1.3.2 Grease Monkey 2.2 Google Chrome 2.2.1 Thiết lập mặc định 2.2.2 Gỡ bỏ các add-on và plug-in vớ vẩn 2.2.3 Cài các add-on hữu ích 1. Thiết lập cho máy tính1.1 Quay về thiết lập mặc địnhTrong quá trình sử dụng máy tính, có nhiều phần mềm yêu cầu cài đặt, và kèm theo nó là các khuyến mãi như các thanh công cụ, các phần mềm rác, vân vân. Việc đầu tiên các bạn cần phải làm là gỡ bỏ các thanh công cụ này Vào Start, gõ Control Panel và mở Control Panel lên Chọn Uninstall a program Tiếp theo là tìm và gỡ bỏ tất cả các phần mềm có chữ “Toolbar” trong đó. Trust me. 1.2 Gỡ bỏ các trình duyệt không chính thốngMột trình duyệt không chính thống là một trình duyệt dựa trên bộ mã nguồn của trình duyệt nào đó, và được quảng cáo là có các tính năng hay hơn, xịn hơn, tốt hơn so với bản gốc. Tin tui đi, các trình duyệt này hoàn toàn sẽ bị đè bẹp bởi bản gốc nếu bạn tiếp tục đọc tiếp bài blog này Các trình duyệt không chính thống là (ý kiến chủ quan): Cờ rôm cộng &#x2F; Cờ rôm Comodo Dragon – Đi kèm khi cài Comodo Internet Security Rockmelt Waterfox Pale Moon Vân vân và vân vân 1.3 Cài đặt một trình duyệt Web chính chủĐối với các bạn đam mê tốc độ cao, ngốn ít ram, mì ăn liền, mình khuyến cáo không nên cài gì cả, mà hãy dùng Edge. Nếu bạn vẫn đang dùng Windows 7, thì bạn có thể xài Internet Explorer Tuy nhiên, cần phải Update Internet Explorer lên bản mới tại đây: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie Nhưng hãy tiếp tục đọc tiếp, nhiều thứ hay ho đang chờ các bạn 1.3.1 Mozilla FirefoxFirefox là một trình duyệt mở (open source), do cộng đồng phát triển, và quản lý bởi Mozilla Foundation. Đây là trình duyệt “trong trắng” nhất hiện nay, nó không chứa các công cụ theo dõi hành vi người dùng, không hỗ trợ và ủng hộ quảng cáo, không tiết lộ thông tin bảo mật và password của người dùng (do nó dùng các thuật toán mã hóa 3DES, được đánh giá là an toàn cho tới năm 2020 (khi đó với các tiến bộ khoa học kỹ thuật, sức mạnh của máy tính tăng lên, thì việc bẻ khóa thuật toán này, hoặc tấn công theo kiểu dò từng mã một sẽ mất ít thời gian hơn) Firefox có các phiên bản khác nhau dành cho những đối tượng khác nhau, nhìn chung, bạn sẽ cần phiên bản chính của nó, download tại đây: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ 1.3.2 Google ChromeGoogle Chrome được xây dựng bởi Google, dựa trên Chromium, cũng được phát triển bởi Google (đúng rồi, Google phát triển cả 2 cái). Điểm khác nhau là Chromium thì mã nguồn mở, bất kỳ ai cũng có thể vào đọc mã nguồn của nó, do đó, Google sẽ không thể “làm điều xằng bậy” trong đấy được, nếu không muốn bị tẩy chay. Còn Google Chrome thì mã nguồn đóng, và kèm theo rất nhiều tính năng mà Chromium không có, và được quảng cáo là tốt hơn nhiều. Chromium không có phiên bản chính thức, cũng chả có phiên bản ổn định chạy được lâu dài (Stable Build), vì dụng ý của Google là bạn không nên xài nó &#x3D;]]. Trên trang chủ của Chromium có đường link dẫn tới Google Chrome &#x3D;]], cho ta thấy mưu đồ thâm sâu của Google Còn Google Chrome, do được Google phát triển, nên sẽ được cài cắm nhiều khuyến mãi mà bạn sẽ không hề ngờ tới, ví dụ như phân tích hành vi người dùng, theo dõi vị trí, theo dõi âm thanh, vân vân và vân vân. Người yêu của bạn cũng không hiểu bạn bằng Google đâu. Nếu bạn thấy những điều trên là chấp nhận được, thì đây là link tải Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html Và tất nhiên, nếu bạn đã cài sẵn một trong 2 cái trên, thì hãy đọc tiếp 2. Tối ưu hóa trình duyệt web2.1 Mozilla Firefox2.1.1 Về thiết lập mặc địnhMở firefox lên, vào option Nếu như thế nào đó mà bạn bị mất cái nút mở ra menu này, trong trình duyệt firefox, nhấn Alt, sẽ thấy xuất hiện menu bar cũ, vào Tool &gt; Option Tại đây, bạn sẽ thấy chỗ chỉnh trang web mặc định mở ra khi bạn mới mở Firefox. Chỉnh nó về Default hoặc như trong hình Ở mục content, bạn có thể bật tùy chọn Block Popup Ở mục Privacy &gt; chọn “Tell site I do not want to be tracked”, cái này sẽ chặn một số website có lương tâm không theo dõi hành vi của bạn trên trang web đó Bật cả 3 tùy chọn sau ở mục Security Sau cùng, chọt vô Advanced &gt; Network &gt; Settings để kiểm tra xem Firefox có đang dùng một cái proxy ất ơ nào đấy không Nếu bạn thấy Use system proxy, hoặc No proxy, vậy là xong, Firefox của bạn đã “sạch” 2.1.2 Gỡ bỏ các Add-on – Plug-in vớ vẩnĐể gỡ bỏ một Add-on, bạn nhấn vào cái nút bên hông firefox &gt; Addon Sau đó chọn dòng Extension, và Remove toàn bộ add-on đi, chừa lại những cái mà bạn biết rõ, hoặc nó có trong danh sách này: IDM CC Noscript uBlock origin Lastpass Đối với plug-in, vì là các phần mềm bên thứ 3 cài cắm vô, nên bạn không thể gỡ nó ra khỏi firefox, tuy nhiên, bạn có lựa chọn không bao giờ kích hoạt các plug-in này Chuyển sang thẻ plug-in, chọn never active đối với các plug-in khả nghi. Lưu ý có một số plug-in cần thiết để Firefox chạy 2.1.3 Cài các Add-on hữu íchDanh sách dưới đây là kinh nghiệm của mình, cài hay không là tùy bạn 2.1.3.1 Color that siteLink tải: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/color-that-site/ Là một add-on khá hay, cho phép bạn đổi màu hoàn toàn một trang web. Các web site hiện nay đa phần xài cái nền trắng bóc, rất hai mắt và tốn điện. Nhìn lâu vào nó, bạn sẽ chỉ muốn đập máy, và bạn ước chi có cách nào đó đổi tất cả màu trắng thành màu đen, và màu chữ đen thành trắng. Color that site ra đời, cho phép bạn thay đổi màu toàn bộ các thành phần trên 1 website, trừ hình ảnh ra. Cách dùng: Sau khi cài đặt xong, bạn sẽ thấy một nút nho nhỏ màu mè tùm lum nằm bên cạnh nút menu. Mở trang web bạn muốn thay đổi màu và nhấn vô nó. Mình sẽ lấy tuoitre.vn làm ví dụ Bên cạnh trái sẽ xuất hiện một thanh nhỏ. Bấm Go! Bạn sẽ thấy một thanh chạy chạy, chờ nó chạy xong, sẽ hiện ra bảng tùy chỉnh. Bạn mở mục Foreground colors, chọn Invert Colors Sau đó tiếp tục mở Background colors, và chọn tiếp Invert Colors. Rồi chuyển sang thẻ Settings chọn domain để áp dụng thay đổi cho toàn bộ domain của tuổi trẻ rồi nhấn nút Save Vậy là xong, bạn có thể chiêm ngưỡng thành quả. Tuoitre.vn giờ đã dễ chịu hơn cho mắt, nhưng chữ vẫn rất rõ ràng dễ đọc. 2.1.3.2 Grease MonkeyLink: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ Grease Monkey là một add-on cho phép bạn chạy thêm các đoạn JavaScript của riêng mình trên một website nhất định nào đó. Vậy tại sao mình phải làm vậy? Một ví dụ đơn giản, khi xem một tấm hình trên flickr, ví dụ như tấm này: https://flic.kr/p/oABXSB Bạn muốn Download nó, nhưng để download một tấm hình trên flickr, bạn phải trải qua rất nhiều bước trước khi có link download. Với Grease Monkey, chỉ cần 1 click là đã download được ngay. Một vấn đề nữa, bạn không phải lập trình viên, làm sao viết được những đoạn script đó cho Grease Monkey? Câu trả lời là đã có người viết những đoạn Script đó cho bạn. Một số trang Script tiu bỉu: https://greasyfork.org/en https://openuserjs.org/ Một vài đoạn Script tiu bỉu: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1190-flickr-original-link - Cho phép bạn download hình trên flickr chỉ với 1 click https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/568-direct-google - Bỏ qua chế độ redirect khi search trên google, giúp bạn mở kết quả tìm kiếm nhanh hơn, đồng thời hiện link “Cached” của kết quả đó Còn rất nhìu đoạn script khác chờ bạn khám phá Một số add-on nâng cao hơn sẽ có ở phần 2 của chủ đề này nhé 2.2 Google Chrome2.2.1 Thiết lập mặc địnhBạn mở GG Chrome, chọt vào nút Menu &gt; Settings Ôi thôi, cái setting dài quá dài. Kéo xuống dưới cùng, chọn Show Advanced Settings…, rồi tiếp tục kéo xuống dưới cùng, sẽ có nút Reset settings. Bấm vào đó để reset lại (Lưu ý làm cái này thì GG Chrome của bạn sẽ như mới) 2.2.2 Gỡ bỏ các add-on và plug-in vớ vẩnCũng trong trang setting, bạn chọn mục Add-on. Ở mỗi đầu add-on sẽ có biểu tượng thùng rác. Bấm vô đó để Remove một add-on tương ứng. Chừa lại các add-on sau: Google Docs Google Sheets Google Slides IDM Integration Module 2.2.3 Cài các add-on hữu íchSố lượng add-on bên Google Chrome thực sự không nhiều và phong phú như bên Firefox, tuy nhiên cũng có một số Add-on tương đương Grease Monkey &#x3D;&gt; TamperMonkey: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?utm_source&#x3D;chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog Color that site &#x3D;&gt; Stylish: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe Phần 2 của bài viết ở đây: Phần 2","categories":[{"name":"Computer Tips","slug":"Computer-Tips","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Computer-Tips/"}],"tags":[{"name":"chrome","slug":"chrome","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/chrome/"},{"name":"firefox","slug":"firefox","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/firefox/"},{"name":"web browser","slug":"web-browser","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/web-browser/"}]},{"title":"[Windows 10] SplitView Control (the sidebar on many apps)","slug":"windows-10-splitview-control-the-sidebar-on-many-apps","date":"2015-06-18T09:37:30.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.565Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/06/18/windows-10-splitview-control-the-sidebar-on-many-apps/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2015/06/18/windows-10-splitview-control-the-sidebar-on-many-apps/","excerpt":"Ngôn ngữ thiết kế của Windows 10 đang được làm mới lại, trong đó có một thanh công cụ nằm bên hông của mỗi app. Làm thế nào để bắt chước cách thiết kế này?","text":"Ngôn ngữ thiết kế của Windows 10 đang được làm mới lại, trong đó có một thanh công cụ nằm bên hông của mỗi app. Làm thế nào để bắt chước cách thiết kế này? SplitView ControlMicrosoft đã xây dựng riêng một control cho việc đó và gọi nó là SplitView Control Cơ bản, nó sẽ có 2 phần: Pane và Content Phần Pane sẽ là nơi đặt các Menu, danh mục này nọ, phần Content sẽ thể hiện nội dung chính của ứng dụng. Có nhiều kiểu thiết kế cho SplitView này tùy theo bạn chọn. Ở đây mình sẽ hướng dẫn cơ bản Tạo một Project mới sử dụng Universal Application Platform (UAP) từ Visual Studio Trong MainPage, paste dòng sau vào Trong cấu trúc trên, bạn có thể thấy Pane là một thuộc tính của SplitView. Hãy coi Pane như một control mẹ và thêm các control khác vào bên trong nó CompactPaneLength là chiều rộng của SplitView khi người dùng thu gọn nó lại DisplayMode là cách thức hiển thị của SplitView. Có 4 kiểu: CompactInline: Khi thu gọn sẽ quay về hình dạng 1 thanh dài bên hông màn hình, khi mở bung ra sẽ đẩy phần Content sang một bên CompactOvelay: Khi thu gọn sẽ quay về hình dạng 1 thanh dài bên hông màn hình, khi mở bung ra sẽ ĐÈ LÊN phàn Content Inline: Giống CompactInline, như khi thu gọn sẽ biết mất khỏi màn hình Overlay: Giống Overlay, nhưng khi thu gọn sẽ biết mất khỏi màn hình Cấu trúcCấu trúc của SplitView bao gồm Pane và Content. Trong Pane sẽ có Hamburger Button và list các tính năng khác. Theo cấu trúc sau đây: Code của cái trên rất đơn giản: &lt;SplitView&gt; &lt;SplitView.Pane&gt; &lt;Grid&gt; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;\\*&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;Button Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; /&gt; &lt;ListView Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; /&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; &lt;/SplitView.Pane&gt; &lt;Grid /&gt; &lt;/SplitView&gt; Hamburger ButtonHamburger Button thực ra cũng không khó.

MAIN TOPICToday’s Main Topic is Hour of Code! Japan: MSP Japan joined Hour of Code On Dec 12th, 2014, one of the events for the Hour of Code by MSPs was carried out with 36 young students who ranged from 15 to 18 of ages at an all girls’ high school in Tokyo. In collaboration with Life is Tech! Microsoft Japan provided the technologies and MSPs helped students write codes as a mentor. Through the event, students learned and developed the programming skills so fast to make an app on time and no one gave up, which made us surprised. From this experience, we now believe the importance for any learner, especially for beginners, to let them have easy access to the first steps with fun and excitement. “MSP Japan Niki Matsumura” New Zealand: The Microsoft Student Accelerator Initiative 2014 has been a hectic but rewarding year for MSP New Zealand! The MSPs, along with Ryan Tarak (BDE, DX, Microsoft New Zealand), launched a brand new initiative called the Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA). The MSA program aims to train students from all around the country on Microsoft technologies and better prepare them for the tech industry of today. The biggest benefit of the program is the placement of qualifying students with New Zealand’s biggest employers in the tech industry so they can gain work experience over the summer. While 600 students trained in the first phase of the program, around 200 students moved on to complete phase 2 and finally, 94 students were placed with employers after rigorous individual and group assessments. A total of 35 employers participated in the program, including the University of Auckland (largest university in New Zealand), Coca-Cola, Lazyworm Apps (developers of MetroTube), Datacom and a few government organizations.

Phần này mình sẽ hướng dẫn cho các bạn cách thiết lập nó để đăng nhập bằng chính Microsoft Account của bạn, và biến nó thành một máy chủ FTP nhé. Login with MS AccountTạo một user mới, dùng Microsoft Account làm username (ví dụ như blahblahblah@hotmail.com chả hạn) Sau khi tạo xong, mở Computer Management, chọn mục Local Users and Groups trong System Tools. User mới tạo sẽ xuất hiện trong mục này với một cái tên bị cắt ngắn. Bạn mở Property của User này lên, chuyển sang thẻ Member of, thêm người này vào nhóm Remote Desktop Users. Trong Control Panel, mở System and Security, chọt Allow Remote Access, bỏ chọn tùy chọn “Allow connections only … with Network Level Authentication”. Bước cuối cùng là mở file .RDP lên bằng notepad, thay đổi dòng “prompt for credentials:i:1” thành “enablecredsspsupport:i:0” Vậy là xong. Sau khi đăng nhập lần đầu tiên, bạn có thể undo 2 bước cuối cùng. FTP ServerCài đặt trên Azure PortalBước đầu tiên, bạn phải tạo một port 21 trong phần quản lý của Azure Click chọn Add trong phần Endpoint của Virtual Machine của bạn Chọn Add a stand alone endpoint và nhấn next Chọn FTP, các thông số sẽ tự điền vô cho bạn (:yay:) Chờ nó hoàn tất Cài đặt trên Virtual MachineCài FileZilla ServerTrên VM, bạn tải FileZilla Server về: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server Khi cài đặt, chấp nhận tất cả các tùy chọn mặc định của nó Mở FileZilla Server lên, chọn Edit &gt; Users Thêm một User mới với tên tùy chọn. Đây là tên bạn sẽ dùng để đăng nhập vào FTP Server của mình sau này Thêm password cho tài khoản này. Nếu không thì Man-in-the-middle sẽ truy cập được và server của bạn và tiến hành phá hoại Tiếp theo, chọn Shared Folders và thêm vào Folder mà bạn sẽ kết nối để download hoặc upload dữ liệu Lưu ý rằng có các tùy chọn cho phép các quyền khác nhau đối với folder, và các quyền này đi theo tài khoản mà bạn đã tạo và đã chọn trong FileZilla Server Lưu ý 2: Không được chọn Folder gốc (C:&#x2F; D:&#x2F; E:&#x2F;), luôn luôn chọn Folder dưới mức gốc 1 level Tiếp tục, mở FileZilla Server Settings, chọn Passive Mode Chọn “Use custom Port Range, và điền một số port cho cả 2 bên (vì bạn sẽ ko muốn tạo ra cả trăm port trên Azure Portal đâu) Tiếp tục chọn Retrieve external IP Address from Thiếp lập FirewallMở Windows Firewall lên và cho phép FileZilla Server Chọn Allow an app through Windows Filewall Nếu bạn không tìm thấy FileZilla Server trong danh sách, thì duyệt tới file thực thi .exe của nó Sau cùng nó phải giống như vầy Tiếp theo, ở Control Panel &gt; Windows Firewall, chọn Advanced Settings Chọn Inbound Rules, và thêm cái custom Port của bạn hồi nãy mới thiếp lập trong FileZilla Server Thiết lập cổng cho cái Inbound Rule này Cài đặt trên Local MachineCài đặt FileZilla ClientTải FileZilla Client tại: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client Khi khởi chạy, điền dải IP trong Public IP trên Azure của bạn Điền các thông tin vào các ô tương ứng và nhấn quick connect Danh sách các Folder bạn đã Share sẽ hiện ra :3 Thử nghiệm tốc độ của FTP Server mới tạoTốc độ mạng của Azure Download Mạng công ty bị QoS chặn download tốc độ cao file lớn (haiza) Upload Mạng công ty bị QoS chặn upload tốc độ cao file lớn (haiza)","categories":[{"name":"Azure","slug":"Azure","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Azure/"}],"tags":[{"name":"file","slug":"file","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/file/"},{"name":"azure","slug":"azure","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/azure/"},{"name":"virtual machine","slug":"virtual-machine","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/virtual-machine/"},{"name":"ftp","slug":"ftp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/ftp/"}]},{"title":"Virtual Machine in Azure Part 1: Create virtual machine and connect to it","slug":"virtual-machine-in-azure-part-1-create-virtual-machine-and-connect-to-it","date":"2014-12-03T17:30:51.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.565Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/12/03/virtual-machine-in-azure-part-1-create-virtual-machine-and-connect-to-it/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/12/03/virtual-machine-in-azure-part-1-create-virtual-machine-and-connect-to-it/","excerpt":"Chào các bạn, vậy là azure đã cho đăng ký chính thức ở Việt Nam.

Bạn được phép tạo một cái máy ảo như máy thật, chạy Windows Server 2012 hoặc 2014, thậm chí là tạo một cái máy ảo chạy thử Windows 10 Technical Preview cũng vẫn được. Tạo máy ảoĐăng nhập vào portal của azure, tạo Storage Account. Bước này có thể làm tự động, nhưng tạo tay sẽ cho phép bạn đặt cho nó một cái tên ý nghĩa: https://manage.windowsazure.com Tiếp theo, tạo một Virtual Machine từ Gallery Ở đây, bạn có thể chọn từ rất nhiều Image, có cả các image có sẵn Visual Studio 2013, và có cả Windows 10 Enterprise Technical Preview Đặt một cái tên mang tính gợi nhớ cho bạn. Ví dụ như Windows81VM hay gì đó đại loại vậy Chọn cấu hình cho máy bạn. Nếu bạn chọn những Image có cài sẵn nhiều thứ, thì nên chọn cấu hình cao cao một chút. Lưu ý là cấu hình càng cao thì càng tốn tiền Tạo username và password cho bạn. Phải nhớ username và password này Availability tức là VM của bạn sẽ được backup ở một số nơi khác ngoài nơi bạn tạo chính. Tất nhiên là sẽ tốn phí Xong hết rồi thì bấm Create. Chờ nó phân vùng, tạo máy ảo, đăng ký, khởi động, blah blah blah rất là lâu. Đăng nhậpTạo xong thì phải đăng nhập. Và bạn sẽ đăng nhập bằng Remote Desktop của Windows Sau khi máy ảo đã khởi động xong, bạn nhấn vào nút connect để tải về một file .RDP. Nút connect chỉ xuất hiện ở dashboard của Virtual Machine mà bạn tạo Double click file này để chạy, bạn sẽ thấy một khung đăng nhập. Bây giờ tới phần éo le Select “Other Account”. Ở ô username, bạn nhập theo cú pháp “hostname\\username”. Hostname lấy trong phần dashboard của virtual machine trong Azure. Password bạn nhập đúng password lúc tạo máy ảo Bạn sẽ gặp phải một vài cảnh báo về chứng chỉ. Cứ việc cho phép nó.

Microsoft cung cấp cho bạn một giải pháp, tuy chưa hoàn hảo, nhưng rất hữu ích. Bạn chỉ cần bấm và click. RetargetĐể retarget ứng dụng từ windows 8 lên 8.1, rất đơn giản, chọn chuột phải vào Project, nhấn Retarget to Windows 8.1 Một bảng nhỏ hiện ra, nói rằng bạn nên backup blah blah blah. Nếu bạn đang dùng version control như TFS, cách backup tốt nhất là check in trước khi retarget Nhấn OK để Visual Studio tiến hành Retarget Khi bạn thấy cái bảng này là thành công….một nửa Fix errors and WarningNhư hình trên bạn cũng thấy, có nhiều Errors và Warning xuất hiện. Yên tâm, khi build thử project, bạn sẽ thấy còn nhiều errors hơn nữa Các errors về ReferencesNhư hình trên, ứng dụng cũ dùng Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows 8 (XAML) version 6.1. Bạn đã Upgrade lên 8.1, thì phải dùng SDK phiên bản mới hơn. Right click Reference trong Project Folder, chọn Add Reference… Bỏ chọn các dòng bị mờ, và chọn dòng sáng rõ tương ứng. Như hình dưới đây. Xong rồi thì nhấn OK Reinstall Nuget PackageCó một số Nuget Package chưa chịu target sang Windows 8.1. Mình sẽ target nó lại bằng cách…Reinstall Mở Tool &gt; Nuget Package Manager &gt; Package Manager Console Có tùy chọn cho phép bạn Reinstall tất cả mọi nuget package, nhưng mà làm vậy thì hơi lâu. Bạn chỉ nên update một số package bị ảnh hưởng thôi. Tên Package bị ảnh hưởng nằm trong dòng thông báo lỗi Gõ dòng lệnh sau vào. Đoạn cuối cùng là tên package Package Manager Console sẽ chạy, nhìn rất chuyên nghiệp :3 Chú ý: khi reinstall Google Analytics SDK, bạn sẽ thấy file bị conflict. Gõ N vô để nó bỏ qua không overwrite cái file này. Tiếp tục làm tương tự cho các package khác. Lần này, bạn chỉ cần gõ phím mũi tên để paste lại lệnh gần nhất. Edit cái tên package là xong Fix warning về ResourceBạn nào làm app Multiple language sẽ gặp warning này. Lý do là method GetValue đã bị obsoleted, bạn cần phải nâng cấp một tí Rất đơn giản. Thêm một dòng “ResourceContext.GetForCurrentView() làm tham số thứ 2 là xong Đổi thành cái này Fix lỗi querry for Windows Size directlyỞ windows 8.1, windows size đã có thể lấy trực tiếp ra ngoài. Vì vậy, dòng này trong Layout Aware Page bị lỗi thời. Sửa bằng cách ta sẽ sửa method DetermineVisualState Chuột phải DetermineVisualState &gt; Go to Definition Sửa lại như sau protected virtual string DetermineVisualState() &#123; string visualState = &quot;FullScreenLandscape&quot;; var windowWidth = Window.Current.Bounds.Width; var windowHeight = Window.Current.Bounds.Height; if (windowWidth &lt;= 500) &#123; visualState = &quot;Snapped&quot; + &quot;_Detail&quot;; &#125; else if (windowWidth &lt;= 1366) &#123; if (windowWidth &lt; windowHeight) &#123; visualState = &quot;FullScreenPortrait&quot; + &quot;_Detail&quot;; &#125; else &#123; visualState = &quot;FilledOrNarrow&quot;; &#125; &#125; return visualState; &#125; Sau đó, thay thế method này với method cũ.

Bạn có thể tưởng tượng bao nhiêu mặc cảm tội lỗi, stress, và căng thẳng sẽ biến mất khi bạn – bằng cách kỳ diệu nào đó – làm những việc mà bạn không muốn làm, mà thực tế là bạn nên làm những việc đó? Tin tốt (rất tốt) là bạn có thể cải thiện tình trạng này, nếu bạn sử dụng các chiến lược đúng đắn. Việc chỉ ra các chiến lược để sử dụng phụ thuộc vào lý do tại sao bạn đang trì hoãn. Lý do #1: Bạn né tránh làm điều gì đó vì bạn sợ sẽ làm hỏng nó. Giải pháp: Áp dụng “Trọng tâm ngăn ngừa” Có 2 cách để nhìn vào bất kỳ nhiệm vụ nào. Bạn có thể làm điều gì đó nếu bạn thấy rằng bạn sẽ kết thúc nó tốt đẹp hơn so với hiện tại. Kiểu như “nếu tôi hoàn thành dự án này, tôi sẽ gây ấn tượng với sếp”, hay “Nếu tôi tập thể dục thường xuyên, thân hình tôi sẽ tuyệt vời”. Các nhà tâm lý học gọi đây là “Trọng tâm cầu tiến” – và các nghiên cứu chỉ ra rằng nếu bạn có một “trọng tâm cầu tiến”, bạn sẽ được thúc đẩy bởi các suy nghĩ đạt được thành quả, và bạn sẽ làm việc tốt nhất khi bạn cảm thấy háo hức và lạc quan. Nghe tốt đấy, phải không. Tuy nhiên nếu bạn sợ rằng bạn sẽ làm hỏng nó, bạn sẽ tạo ra sự lo lắng và nghi ngờ, làm cho bạn ít có khả năng thực hiện bất kỳ hành động nào cả. Cái bạn cần là một cách nhìn mà không bị ảnh hưởng bởi yếu tố nghi ngờ. Khi bạn có một “trọng tâm ngăn ngừa”, thay vì suy nghĩ bạn sẽ hoàn tất nó tốt đẹp hơn như thế nào, hãy suy nghĩ công việc đó là cách mà bạn sẽ bảo toàn những gì đang có – ngăn ngừa mất mát. Ví dụ đối với một trọng tâm ngăn ngừa: “Hoàn tất dự án này sẽ làm cho sếp không tức giận” hay “tập thể dục thường xuyên để ngăn ngừa cơ thể phì nộn”. Hàng thập kỷ nghiên cứu, điều mà tôi đã mô tả trong quyển Focus, chỉ ra rằng động lực ngăn ngừa được tăng cường bởi sự lo lắng về những điều có thể đi sai so với kế hoạch. Khi bạn tập trung vào ngăn ngừa mất mát, bạn nhận ra rằng cách duy nhất để thoát ra khỏi nguy hiểm là hành động ngay lập tức. Càng lo lắng nhiều bao nhiêu, thì bạn sẽ hoàn tất công việc đó nhanh bấy nhiêu. Tôi biết rằng điều này rất không thoải mái, đặc biệt là khi bạn thường có “Trọng tâm cầu tiến” (đa số mọi người đều có), nhưng đây có thể là cách duy nhất để bạn vượt qua sự lo lắng về làm hỏng mọi thứ, thay vì suy nghĩ về những hậu quả thảm khốc khi bạn không làm gì cả. Cố lên, sợ tụt quần đi. Khủng khiếp nhưng nó có ích. Lý do #2: Bạn né tránh điều gì đó vì bạn không “cảm thấy” như làm việc đó. Giải pháp: Cư xử như Spock, bỏ qua cảm xúc của bạn. Nó đang chặn đường đi của bạn. Giải thích một tý: Khi bạn nói “Tôi sẽ đọc sách tại thư viện”, thì não bạn sẽ tự động tưởng tượng ra cảnh mình đi tới thư viện, chọn một quyển sách, và ngồi vào một cái ghế và đọc. Điều này xảy ra nhanh tới mức bạn không hề nghĩ rằng mình đã có những suy nghĩ đó. Khi bạn không thể tưởng tượng được cảnh này, bạn sẽ thấy mình không có cảm giác làm những việc đó. Trong một quyển sách xuất sắc của mình: “Thuốc giải: Hạnh phúc cho người không thể có tư duy tích cực”, Oliver Burkeman chỉ ra rằng rất nhiều lần chúng ta nói “Tôi không thể rời khỏi giường lúc sáng sớm”, hay “Tôi không thể tập thể dục được”, thực ra ý của bạn là bạn không có cảm giác mình làm những điều đó. Sau cùng, chả có ai trói bạn trên giường buổi sáng sớm cả, cũng chả có tên côn đồ nào chặn đường đi tới phòng tập thể dục của bạn. Không có gì mang tính vật chất đang chặn đường của bạn – chẳng qua là bạn không có cảm giác làm việc đó. Tuy nhiên, mắc gì bạn phải chờ cho tới khi có “cảm giác” làm điều gì để để thực sự làm nó? Hãy nghĩ về nó một tí, vì nó rất quan trọng. Trước tới giờ, chúng ta đều tin rằng để có động lực và hiệu quả, chúng ta cần phải có cảm giác rằng chúng ta muốn hành động. Phải sẵn sàng để làm điều đó. Tôi không biết tại sao chúng ta tin vào điều đó, vì nó 100% vô nghĩa. Đúng là ở một mức độ nào đó, bạn cần phải có một cam kết với những gì bạn đang làm. Bạn cần phải có sự mong muốn dự án hoàn tất, hoặc khỏe mạnh hơn, hoặc dậy sớm hơn. Nhưng bạn chả cần phải có cảm giác làm điều đó. Trên thực thế, như Burkeman đã chỉ ra, rất nhiều họa sĩ, nhà văn, nhà sáng tạo đạt năng suất làm việc cao do họ có một thói quen hằng ngày bắt buộc họ làm việc trong một khoảng thời gian nhất định mỗi ngày, không quan trọng là họ có cảm hứng hay không. Burkeman dẫn chứng lời của họa sỹ Chuck Close: “Cảm hứng là dành cho mấy tên nghiệp dư, phần còn lại như chúng tôi chỉ đơn giản là xuất hiện và làm việc”. Vì vậy, nếu bạn đang ngồi đó, né tránh làm việc chỉ vì bạn không có cảm giác làm những việc đó, hãy nhớ rằng bạn thực sự chả cần cảm giác đó. Chả có gì ngăn cản bạn cả. Lý do #3: Bạn né tránh làm việc vì nó khó, nó chán, hay nó khó chịu Giải pháp: Sử dụng cách lên kế hoạch “Nếu – thì” Rất thường xuyên, chúng ta cố gắng giải quyết các vấn đề đặc biệt với một ý chí: “Lần tới, tôi sẽ làm cho bản thân mình bắt đầu làm việc này sớm hơn”. Dĩ nhiên là chúng ta có một sức mạnh ý chí để làm điều đó, chúng ta không bao giờ né tránh nó lúc mới bắt đầu cả. Nghiên cứu chỉ ra rằng chúng ta thường đánh giá quá cao khả năng tự kiểm soát của mình, và dựa vào nó quá nhiều để tránh khỏi rắc rối. Hãy cho mình một đặc ân, thừa nhận rằng sức mạnh ý chí là có hạn, và nó có thể sẽ không luôn luôn làm cho bạn làm những việc bạn thấy khó khăn, tẻ nhạt hoặc khủng khiếp. Thay vào đó, hãy sử dụng cách lên kế hoạch “Nếu – thì” Lên kế hoạch “Nếu – thì” phức tạp hơn là vạch ra các bước bạn phải làm, nó còn là quyết định xem địa điểm và thời gian bạn làm những bước đó. “Nếu tới 2:00 PM, tôi sẽ dừng việc tôi đang làm để bắt đầu viết báo cáo mà Bob yêu cầu” “Nếu sếp không đề cập tới chuyện tăng lương của tôi trong buổi họp tới, tôi sẽ nhắc lại nó trước khi buổi họp kết thúc” Bằng cách quyết định trước một cách chính xác những gì bạn dự định làm, và khi điều kiện xảy ra, bạn sẽ không phải cân nhắc có nên làm việc đó hay không, hay bạn có nên làm một việc khác với việc bạn dự định làm hay không. Khi chúng ta cân nhắc, ý chí trở nên cần thiết cho các lựa chọn khó khăn. Tuy nhiên, dùng kế hoạch “Nếu – thì” sẽ làm giảm đáng kể yêu cầu cần tới ý chí, bằng cách đảm bảo rằng bạn đã ra quyết định đúng đắn trước khi thời điểm đó xảy ra. Trên thực tế, cách lên kế hoạch “Nếu – thì” đã được thể hiện trong hơn 200 nghiên cứu rằng nó sẽ làm tăng tỷ lệ đạt mục tiêu và nâng cao năng suất lên 200% đến 300% Tôi nhận ra rằng 3 chiến lược mà tôi giới thiệu cho bạn – suy nghĩ về cách giảm thiểu hậu quả, mặc kệ cảm giác của mình, gắn kết với một kế hoạch điều kiện – không nghe vui vẻ hoặc hay ho như “Hãy đi theo niềm đam mê của bạn”, “Hãy tích cực”. Nhưng nó có lợi thế quyết định bởi thực sự đạt hiệu quả - điều mà bạn sẽ có khi bạn sử dụng chúng","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"[Not so Basic] – Solve your problems","slug":"not-so-basic-solve-your-problems","date":"2014-06-27T11:25:45.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/06/27/not-so-basic-solve-your-problems/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/not-so-basic-solve-your-problems/","excerpt":"Okie, bạn đã có trong tay hầu như mọi thứ cần thiết để tạo ra ứng dụng của mình: [Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 1] – Layout with XAML [Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 2] – Layout with XAML [Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 3] – App’s Structure and how customized it [Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 4] – Basic Steps for a new app [Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 5] – Analytics for your apps [Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 6] – Source Control Và trong lúc làm, bạn gặp phải một vấn đề gì đó.

Vân vân và vân vân. Đây là loại vấn đề mà bạn cần phải giải quyết trước khi tiếp tục xây dựng ứng dụng của mình Giải quyết vấn đề của bạnBước đầu tiên, một phương pháp ultimate để giải quyết rất nhiều vấn đề, từ ngớ ngẩn đến phức tạp. Google nó. Search GoogleSearch bằng tiếng anh cho vấn đề của bạn.Cái này chỉ là kinh nghiệm cá nhân. Bạn sẽ dễ dàng bắt gặp vấn đề của mình hơn, và khả năng cao là đã có người giải quyết được. Tuy nhiên, cái này đỏi hỏi bạn phải có khả năng tiếng anh tốt Tham khảo các đoạn code mẫu từ các nguồn uy tínMột trang diễn đàn không tên tuổi sẽ không thể nào đánh bại một câu trả lời được đánh dấu và bình chọn trong StackOverflow. Một đoạn code nằm lưng chừng không thể nào bằng một bài viết trong Nokia Developer. Và uy tín hơn hết tất cả các thứ trên cộng lại, đó chính là thư viện tham khảo MSDN. Tuy nhiên thư viện này chỉ là một bộ tài liệu khổng lồ cho Microsoft Technologies. Hoạt động không khác gì một quyển từ điển. Bạn có thể tra cứu định nghĩa hàm, chức năng, tham số, giá trị. Vân vân và vân vân. Từ khóa, từ khóa, từ khóaTừ khóa đóng một vai trò quan trọng khi tìm kiếm vấn đề của bạn. Ví dụ như cùng một vấn đề, trên Windows có thể sẽ dùng thuật toán này, nhưng Windows Phone sẽ dùng thuật toán khác. Vì Windows Phone có nguồn tài nguyên giới hạn hơn rất nhiều lần so với Windows. Vì vậy hãy thêm từ khóa: Windows Phone vào Mà khoan. Các công nghệ .NET của Microsoft phát triển liên tục. Vì vậy bạn phải kèm theo luôn số phiên bản của nền tảng bạn đang lập trình. Ví dụ: Querry SQL database in Windows Phone 8.1 AskKhi bạn gặp một vấn đề về kỹ thuật, mà chỉ có người tạo ra kỹ thuật đó mới có thể giài quyết, cách tốt nhất là “hỏi”. Tuy nhiên, hỏi ở đây không có nghĩa là bạn bắt tay vào hỏi liền tại chỗ. Kiểu này rất hay gặp đối với sinh viên Việt Nam. Bạ đâu cũng hỏi. Hỏi cũng cần phải có văn hóa riêng. Giả sử như bạn đang gặp một vấn đề về kết nối mạng. Bạn mới thử chừng 1-2 cách nhưng chưa cách nào thành công. Bạn liền kiếm ngay một đàn anh, một chiên za, ít ra cũng là một người có hiểu biết về vấn đề này để hỏi. Nếu họ lịch sự, họ sẽ trả lời. Nếu không, họ sẽ im lặng, và bạn đánh giá họ là “không nhiệt tình”. Why? You asked?Vì mục tiêu chính của bạn không phải là học hỏi. Mà là lợi dụng sự hiểu biết của họ để giải quyết vấn đề cho mình. Có hẳn một công việc trả lương cho nó, đó là “Tư vấn”. Đặc biệt là tư vấn kỹ thuật giá rất mắc, mà bạn đang muốn miễn phí ư? No way. Ít ra bạn cũng phải cho họ biết tường tận vấn đề của mình, bạn đã thử những cách nào, kết quả ra sao, chuẩn đoán của bạn là gì (phải thử chừng 10 cách rồi hẵng hỏi), và đừng bắt họ phải trả lời ngay. Rất có thể trong những cách mà bạn thử nghiệm, có nhiều cách hay ho mới lạ sẽ mở đường cho một hướng đi mới, một công nghệ mới, hoặc sẽ là bình minh của cả một ngành khoa học mới. Và người được hỏi sẽ rất có hứng thú trả lời câu hỏi của bạn, thậm chí mời bạn tới trao đổi thêm. Bạn có biết một nhà khoa học khi cố gắng chứng minh một tiên đề Euclid, ông ấy đã thử một cách mà trở thành một ngành toán học mới, gọi là “Hình học phi Euclid”. Nhà khoa học đó tên là Lobachevsky. Và điều tối quan trọng là “Search trước khi hỏi”. Vấn đề đối với bạn là lạ hoắc, nhưng đối với những người khác thì vô cùng cơ bản, và đã có câu trả lời nằm chình ình ở một chỗ nào đó. BrainstormĐối với các vấn đề mà chỉ có mình bạn giải quyết được. Thì Brainstorm là giải pháp duy nhất. Tại sao chỉ có mình bạn giải quyết được nó? Vì bạn là người duy nhất suy nghĩ về nó. Hãy thử 40 phương pháp sáng tạo (google it). Hãy thử đảo ngược vấn đề, hãy thử suy nghĩ theo một hướng khác. Share your ideaChia sẻ vấn đề của bạn, ý tưởng của bạn, và bạn sẽ có những cải tiến đáng giá, ít ra là những khuyết điểm mà bạn không hề nhận thức rằng nó tồn tại. Đối với các loại vấn đề, bạn có thể sẽ gặp những cách giải quyết vô cùng sáng tạo. Tuy nhiên, hãy đề phòng nạn “đạo ý tưởng”, xảy ra ở khắp mọi nơi trên thế giới. Vì vậy, chỉ chia sẻ cho những người mà bạn biết rằng họ sẽ không ăn cắp ý tưởng của mình, trừ phi bạn có đăng ký bảo hộ ý tưởng đó :3","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"}],"tags":[{"name":"problem","slug":"problem","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/problem/"},{"name":"solve","slug":"solve","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/solve/"}]},{"title":"[Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 6] – Source Control","slug":"basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-6-source-control","date":"2014-05-02T13:55:19.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/05/02/basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-6-source-control/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/05/02/basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-6-source-control/","excerpt":"Hãy thử tưởng tượng, bạn đã làm xong một thành phần nào đó trong ứng dụng của mình.

Bấm nút Add để thêm mới Thành viên bắt buộc phải sử dụng một tài khoản Microsoft để sử dụng dịch vụ này Trong toàn bộ các ProjectỞ trang đầu tiên, nhấn vào nút Users để xem danh sách toàn bộ thành viên có trong tài khoản của bạn Hiện tại có nhiều loại tài khoản, VS Utimate with MSDN là tài khoản của các bạn Microsoft Student Parter, Early Adopter là tài khoản miễn phí, sau này sẽ được đổi thành Basic Nếu bạn là một MSP, bạn có thể dùng MSDN Subscription của mình để đăng ký VSO. Bạn có thể thêm không giới hạn các tài khoản VS Ultimate with MSDN. Nhưng bạn chỉ được thêm tối đa 5 tài khoản Basic thôi. Hình dưới đây sẽ thể hiện điều đó Vậy là xong, Bây giờ, hãy mở Visual Studio lên để thiết lập nhé Trên Visual StudioConnect tới tài khoản của bạnChọn Menu &gt; Team &gt; Connect to Team Foudation Server Đăng nhập bằng chính tài khoản Microsoft bạn đã dùng để tạo Online Server có dạng: https://nickname.visualstudio.com Sau khi đăng nhập, tất cả các Project có sẵn trên Server sẽ được hiện ra. Tick vào các Project bạn muốn connect (các project bạn đang làm việc) và nhấn Connect Thêm Project vào Source ControlBạn mở Solution của mình lên Sau khi mở ra, nhấn chuột phải vào Solution &gt; Add Solution to Source Control…, bạn sẽ được hỏi sử dụng dịch vụ nào. Git là một dịch vụ miễn phí, và khó sử dụng hơn so với Team Foundation. Một bản hiện ra, bạn chọn Project bạn vừa tạo trên Web, rồi nhấn OK Quá trình thêm vào diễn ra âm thầm. Có thể bạn sẽ cảm nhận được Visual Studio bị đơ 2-3 giây. Sau đó, trước mỗi file trong Solution, sẽ có 1 biểu tượng dấu + Lúc này, Project của bạn đã được quản lý bởi Source Control Team Foundation Server. Tuy nhiên, đây mới chỉ là “thay đổi”. Bạn cần phải Check in để các thay đổi này được lưu lại. Bấm chuột phải vào Solution &gt; Check In… Trong ô Comment, bạn nhập vào chú thích của lần check in này Mục Included Changes (number) là nơi liệt kê các tập tin trong Solution đã bị thay đổi và sẽ được lưu lại Source Control trong lần check in này Sau khi kiểm tra tất cả các chi tiết, bạn nhấn Check in Sau khi check in thành công, một thông báo nhỏ xuất hiện, thông báo số changeset. Bạn sẽ cần con số này để phục hồi về sau Quay trở lại Solution Explorer, bạn sẽ thấy trước mỗi file có hình một chiếc khóa, biểu hiện cho việc file này từ lần check in trước chưa bị thay đổi Chỉnh sửa và Check inKhi bạn bắt đầu chỉnh sửa một file nào đó, biểu tượng chiếc khóa bị thay đổi Để thay đổi này lưu vào Source Control, bạn nhấn chuột phải lên nó và chọn Check in. Lưu ý, khi thay đổi nhiều file trong Project, bạn có thể chọn cả Project để check in. Nếu thay đổi trong nhiều Project, bạn có thể chọn cả Solution để check in. Thông thường, chọn cả Solution sẽ đảm bảo bạn không “Check in” thiếu thứ gì. Team Foundation sẽ tự động tìm ra các file bị thay đổi của bạn Get Latest Version – Get Specific Version – Undo Pending ChangeNếu bạn làm trong một dự án nhiều thành viên, và các thành viên kia hoàn tất phần code của họ và Check in lên Server. Bạn sẽ phải lấy các phần code mới nhất về Nhấn chuột phải vào phần bạn muốn cập nhật &gt; Get Latest Version (Recursive) Recursive tức là đệ quy. Tất cả các file bên trong nó cũng sẽ được cập nhật theo Khi bạn dùng lệnh này mà một số file của bạn có thay đổi chưa check in, nếu Team Foundation thấy có thể xử lý, nó sẽ xử lý giúp bạn luôn bằng cách gộp chung các thay đổi này với nhau. Tuy nhiên nếu có các thay đổi xung đột nhau, bạn sẽ có tùy chọn xem các xung đột để ra quyết định Get Specific version lại là một cách khác để đưa Project hoặc file nào đó về hiện trạng y hệt như một lần check in nào đó. Bạn có thể dùng số Changeset, hoặc ngày tháng để tìm kiếm toàn bộ các lần check in và quyết định “phục hồi” Undo Pending Change xóa bỏ toàn bộ các thay đổi của bạn, và đưa Project hoặc file về lần Check in gần nhất. Như vậy, bạn đã có trong tay một cỗ máy thời gian thần kỳ để kiểm soát Source Code của mình, đồng thời hợp tác làm Team một các hiệu quả","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"},{"name":"Windows Store App","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone/Windows-Store-App","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/Windows-Store-App/"}],"tags":[{"name":"source control","slug":"source-control","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/source-control/"},{"name":"Team foundation","slug":"Team-foundation","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Team-foundation/"}]},{"title":"[Windows Store] Universal Apps across all Windows devices","slug":"windows-store-universal-apps-across-all-windows-devices","date":"2014-04-13T13:24:26.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/04/13/windows-store-universal-apps-across-all-windows-devices/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/04/13/windows-store-universal-apps-across-all-windows-devices/","excerpt":"Ở hội nghị BUILD 2014, Microsoft đã nhắc tới Universal App, ứng dụng có thể chạy được trên cả Windows và Windows Phone Và ngay bây giờ, từ bản cập nhật Update 2 RC của Visual Studio 2013, bạn đã có thể xây dựng một ứng dụng như thế","text":"Ở hội nghị BUILD 2014, Microsoft đã nhắc tới Universal App, ứng dụng có thể chạy được trên cả Windows và Windows Phone Và ngay bây giờ, từ bản cập nhật Update 2 RC của Visual Studio 2013, bạn đã có thể xây dựng một ứng dụng như thế 1. Cập nhật Visual Studio 2013 lên Update 2 RCNgày 13-04-2014: Link tải: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2014/04/09/deep-dive-visual-studio-2013-update-2-rc-and-azure-sdk-2-3.aspx 2. Tạo Project UniversalSau khi cài đặt xong, bạn sẽ có thêm một số tùy chọn mới trong Visual Studio Chọn New Project Chọn Visual C# &gt; Store Apps &gt; Universal Apps Tạo project xong, bạn sẽ có một Solution như trong hình dưới Nhìn vào là ta cũng biết ngay, Project Windows 8.1 và project Windows Phone 8.1 Còn Project “Shared” sẽ chứa các file dùng chung, cụ thể là Model và View Model Ta sẽ tạo một ứng dụng đọc tin RSS đơn giản nhé 3. Xây dựng Model và ViewModelTạo 2 thư mục mới tên là Model và ViewModel trong Project Shared Giả sử ta lấy trang này làm nguồn tin: http://nhipsongso.tuoitre.vn/RssFeeds.aspx?ChannelID=430 Vậy Model sẽ bao gồm 1 title và 1 content Ta tạo class News với 2 Properties là Title và Content, tương ứng với 2 biến là title và content Tạo file class trong Folder “Model” Kết quả Tạo 2 biến private, dùng Resharper generate code ra Property À mà quên, bạn phải khai báo kế thừa từ Interface INotifyPropertyChanged Sau đó dùng Generate Code của Resharper Chọn Property Chọn luôn như hình, bấm finish Thế là xong Model Tạo class NewsViewModel trong Folder ViewModel Trong class đó, khai báo một ObservableCollection Tạo thêm một class StaticViewModels trong Folder ViewModel. File class này sẽ chứa các biến ViewModel dạng static mà ta sẽ sử dụng trong toàn App (Trước kia bạn thường khai báo chúng trực tiếp trong file App.xaml.cs, nay gom nó lại một nơi để dễ quản lý) Trong file này, khai báo một Intance của NewsViewModel Tạo một thư mục Utilities, trong đó, tạo một class StaticMethod. Ta sẽ nhét code lấy HTML vào đây Trong này, gõ lệnh như sau Mở lại file NewsViewModel, tạo thêm method GetNewsAsyncTask Thư viện HtmlDocument lấy từ HtmlAgilityPack trong Nuget, bạn phải add nó vào trong References của Project Windows 8.1 Sau khi xong, mở file MainPage.xaml của Project Windows 8.1 lên, thêm vào đó một ListBox để hiển thị danh sách tin Sau đó, mở file Code Behind và thêm những dòng sau: Chạy thử 4. Xây dựng TemplateMở file MainPage.xaml trong Project Windows 8.1 Click chuột phải vào ListBox &gt; Edit Additional Template &gt; Create Empty Trong hộp thoại hiện ra, đặt tên nó là DataTemplate Edit lại thành như sau Nhấn nút Local Machine để chạy thử Thật tuyệt phải không? 5. Tạo tương tự bên Windows Phone 8.1Mở file MainPage.xaml của Project Windows Phone 8.1, copy và paste những thứ tương tự nhau Tiếp tục mở code behind, và làm tương tự Chọn lại Startup Project Ôi không, lỗi xuất hiện :’( Khi bạn chọn Startup Project là Windows Phone, vì trong Reference của Windows Phone chưa có thư viện HtmlAgilityPack nên các tham chiếu tới thư viện này đều gặp lỗi Ta add thêm thư viện này thông qua Nuget Một lỗi xuất hiện Nó phàn nàn là cái package này chả chứa file nào target tới Windows Phone 8.1 cả. Vì dùng chung một bộ thư viện với Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 có khả năng add các DLL chỉ tương thích với Windows 8.1. Chọn References &gt; Ad References… Chọn mục Browse &gt; Nhấn nút Browse, tìm đến thư mục bin &gt; Debug của Windows 8.1 để add thư viện HtmlAgilityPack Và khi add xong, woala, mọi lỗi đã biến mất, code đã “green” trở lại Lưu ý: Copy file Annotation.cs trong thư mục Property của Project Windows 8.1 và Paste nó vào bất kỳ chỗ nào trong Project Windows Phone (thực hiện việc Copy và Paste này trên Solution Explorer nhé). Nếu bạn có Resharper, bạn có thể để Resharper tự sinh lại file này bằng cách xóa các method OnPropertyChanged trong News Model, và để Resharper Implement lại nó Chạy thử Project WP8.1 Done, bạn đã tự tạo một UniversalApp rồi đấy 6. XAML và CodeBehind dùng chungNhư bạn có thể thấy ở hình trên, XAML và CodeBehind ở cả 2 Project rất giống nhau, hầu như không thay đổi gì cả Cách đây rất lâu, trong một buổi training tại văn phòng Microsoft, đã có người từng hỏi “tại sao không dùng chung XAML cho cả Windows 8 và Windows Phone?”. Câu trả lời khi đó là Windows 8 và Windows Phone có bộ thư viện hơi khác nhau, nên một số control cũng khác nhau. Bây giờ, Microsoft đã đem lại khả năng “dùng chung” đó Tạo một Folder tên View trong Project Shared Add New một BlankPage, đặt tên nó là MainPage Copy và Paste code từ Project Windows Phone (cả XAML lẫn code Behind) Ở trên cùng của XAML Editor, bạn sẽ thấy một Drop down list thú vị Ở đây, bạn có thể thay đổi kiểu View mà Code XAML này được compile, trong hình đang chọn Windows Phone Hãy thử chuyển nó sang Windows, bạn sẽ thấy giao diện Visual Editor thay đổi Mở file App.xaml.cs, kéo xuống dòng 98, chỉnh sửa thành View.MainPage Chỉnh Startup Project là Windows Chạy thử Chỉnh Startup Project thành Windows Phone, nhấn chạy thử Thế là xong, bạn đã có một Page hiển thị được ở cả 2 giao diện nhé. Trong các bài Blog sau, mình hy vọng sẽ có giải thích rõ ràng hơn về các Control dùng chung và cách hiển thị của chúng trên giao diện. Dù sao thì đây mới chỉ là Release Candidate. Sẽ còn thay đổi nhiều trong tương lai.","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"},{"name":"Windows Store App","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone/Windows-Store-App","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/Windows-Store-App/"}],"tags":[{"name":"windows phone","slug":"windows-phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-phone/"},{"name":"windows store","slug":"windows-store","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-store/"},{"name":"universal","slug":"universal","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/universal/"}]},{"title":"[Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 5] – Analytics for your apps","slug":"basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-5-analytics-for-your-apps","date":"2014-04-04T14:28:33.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/04/04/basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-5-analytics-for-your-apps/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/04/04/basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-5-analytics-for-your-apps/","excerpt":"Phân tích hành vi người dùng là một điều hết sức cần thiết và quan trọng trong việc cải thiện chất lượng ứng dụng của bạn.

Khai báo thông tin Sau khi chạy xong, Project của bạn sẽ có thêm một số thứ mới File analytics.xml File này chứa các thông số cần thiết để Google Analytics theo dõi ứng dụng của bạn. Trong file này có các dòng comment vô cùng đầy đủ, bạn có thể Comment out nó và tự điền các thông số mong muốn File analytics.xsd Là file compiled của file trên, bạn không cần quan tâm tới file này 2. Trên Google Analytics vào link này: Google Analytics Account Nhấn nút Đăng nhập Chọn tab Quản trị Tạo thuộc tính mới Chọn các thông số phù hợp. Lưu ý, ở mục “Bạn muốn theo dõi điều gì”, chọn Ứng dụng di động nhé Sau đó, bạn sẽ có 1 ID theo dõi dạng UA-#######-##, copy chuỗi này và paste vào bên trong file analytics.xml trong project của bạn 3. Thiết lập theo dõi Về cơ bản, bạn có thể theo dõi rất nhiều thứ, bao gồm: Màn hình ứng dụng: màn hình nào người dùng sử dụng nhiều Event: Nút nào được click nhiều, sự kiện nào xảy ra nhiều Exception: Lỗi nào bị bắt nhiều nhất Transaction: Thanh toán, mua đồ, In-app Purchase Social: Chia sẻ trong mạng xã hội Timing: thời gian mà ứng dụng chạy một task nào đó Và tất nhiên, bạn sẽ có các con số sau đây: Số lượng người dùng Người dùng mới cài đặt trong ngày Người dùng đang sử dụng app hiện tại (Realtime) Mức độ trung thành Tỷ lệ thoát ứng dụng Phiên bản ứng dụng (cái này phải cài đặt trong file XML) 3.1. Coding Trong sự kiện RootFrame_NavigationFailed, thêm đoạn code sau GoogleAnalytics.EasyTracker.GetTracker().SendException(e.Exception.Message, false); Đoạn code này có nhiệm vụ theo dõi các Exception khi lỗi chuyển trang Trong sự kiện Application_UnhandledException, thêm đoạn code sau: GoogleAnalytics.EasyTracker.GetTracker().SendException(e.ExceptionObject.Message, false); Đoạn code này có nhiệm vụ theo dõi các Exception cho tất cả các lỗi khác Trong method InitializePhoneApplication(), khai báo một Event Handler: csharp // Track Navigation RootFrame.Navigated += RootFrame_Navigated; Trong Event Handler, thêm đoạn code sau: csharp if (e.Content != null) &#123; GoogleAnalytics.EasyTracker.GetTracker().SendView(e.Content.ToString()); &#125; 4. Xem Analytics Xem kết quả Analytics khá thú vị ở chỗ nó cho phép bạn xem rất nhiều thông tin, mà cái hay nhất có lẽ là số người dùng hiện tại đang sử dụng app Bạn có thể khám phá thêm trong trang Google Analytics của mình.

Không bao giờ bắt tay vào viết ứng dụng mới khi bạn chưa hề biết ứng dụng của bạn sẽ làm gì Bí ý tưởng, hãy lên google play store, Apple App Store để học hỏi từ những ứng dụng hay ho trên đó, nhưng đừng sao chép chúng, hãy tận dụng ý tưởng của họ, cải tiến nó, làm nó tốt hơn, bằng cách dưới đây 1.1 Tinh gọt ý tưởng của bạnKhi đã có ý tưởng rồi, việc tiếp theo bạn làm là sẽ đánh giá ý tưởng đó. Nghe có vẻ khá buồn cười, nhưng tôi khuyên bạn viết ra giấy câu sau đây: “[Tên ứng dụng] is the best app of its kind in [chức năng chính], [điểm nổi bật]“ Ví dụ nhé: “Karaoke Online Free is the best app of its kind in singing karaoke on windows phone, it helps people singing at most 2 taps” Tên ứng dụng: Karaoke Online Free (search trên store, bạn sẽ thấy ứng dụng này có hơn 4000 review, trung bình 4.3 sao) Chức năng chính: hát karaoke trên điện thoại windows phone Điểm nổi bật: sử dụng vô cùng đơn giản, chỉ cần 2 chạm là đã có thể hát 1.2 Stick to the planBạn đã có một câu “review” đầy quyền lực mới tạo ra bên trên rồi, hãy bám chặt lấy nó. Giả sử khi làm xong, bạn cần tới 3 chạm, hoặc 4 chạm mới có thể hát được, thì ứng dụng của bạn vẫn chưa hoàn chỉnh. Điều tệ hại nhất là “tính năng chính” mà ứng dụng bạn cung cấp lại không hoàn hảo. Kế hoạch là hát karaoke trên điện thoại, sau cùng bạn chỉ làm được việc tra cứu bài hát hoặc lời nhạc, thì đây là một ý tưởng fail hoàn toàn, vì ứng dụng bạn viết ra không dành cho mục đích đó. 2 Tạo projectTạo một Project mới, quá đơn giản rồi phải không? 2.1 Cài đặt các gói Nuget cần thiếtỨng dụng của bạn sẽ cần 1 số thư viện ngoài, và các thư viện này có thể cài đặt qua Nuget: [Visual Studio] NUGET the Magician Giới thiệu một số gói Nuget hay ho: HTMLAgilityPack: thao tác với chuỗi HTML JSON.NET: thao tác với dữ liệu json Windows Phone Toolkit: bộ toolkit các control và tiện ích cộng thêm cho ứng dụng 2.2 Tạo các folder chínhĐặt tất các các page bạn sẽ tạo trong một folder tên là PageGroups. Điều này giúp bản quản lý code dễ dàng hơn, dễ dàng chỉnh sửa hơn, và bạn sẽ luôn biết một đoạn code nằm ở đâu. Nếu ứng dụng phức tạp hơn, mỗi một mục nội dung, hãy tạo cho nó một folder trong PageGroups, ví dụ như “LoginGroup”, “SettingGroup” Đặt tất cả các đoạn code dùng chung trong một thư mục tên là Utilities. Đoạn code dùng chung có thể là một method chuyển đổi đơn vị, một method lấy dữ liệu từ API, chúng có thể gọi từ bất kỳ page nào trong ứng dụng (tất nhiên là những method này “Static”) Tạo một folder cho Data hoặc Database. Bạn sẽ không muốn để Database ngay bên ngoài Project đâu Tạo một Folder cho các Data Model, một folder cho CustomControl Chốt: Tạo folder cho tất cả những thứ bạn thấy có thể gom nhóm lại với nhau. Nên nhớ, trong folder có thể tạo thêm folder khác. Hãy quản lý chúng thật chặt chẽ 2.3 Cần một file cho ViewModel, hay StaticDataNếu bạn đã biết về MVC, hay MVVM, thì bạn sẽ biết rằng trong các ví dụ, họ thường tạo các class ViewModel ngay trong App.xaml.cs Vậy thì tại sao ta không tạo hẳn một file chỉ để chứa những class này? Tạo một file mới tên là “ViewModelInstances” để chứa các ViewModel, và khai báo các ViewModel như cũ Bạn cũng sẽ cần một file gọi là StaticData, để lưu những dữ liệu trung gian, tồn tại suốt thời gian chạy app 3 Các Page cơ bản phải có3.1 AboutAbout nói về bạn và ứng dụng của bạn. About page chỉ mất khoản 5 phút để làm, nhưng bạn sẽ có một ứng dụng ấn tượng Thậm chí, about còn có thể đóng các vai trò sau: Nhắc người dùng Rate và Review ứng dụng của bạn Cho phép người dùng gửi thư góp ý, hoặc UserVoice Thể hiện các change log Quảng cáo cho các ứng dụng khác của bạn 3.2 SettingSetting là page mà người dùng có thể tinh chỉnh một số thiết lập trong ứng dụng của bạn. Page này giúp người dùng có cảm giác như “Điều khiển” được ứng dụng theo cách họ muốn Nếu ứng dụng của bạn ko có gì để setting cả, thì page này cũng không cần thiết. Nhưng hãy cân nhắc kỹ, các ứng dụng viết vội vàng thường kém chất lượng và không có các tùy chọn 4 Chuẩn bị dữ liệu4.1 Tạo ModelModel là cấu trúc dữ liệu của bạn. Thường thì công việc này, bạn phải tạo bằng tay. Tuy nhiên, nếu bạn nhận dữ liệu dạng Json, thì có một các vui hơn để tự động hóa việc này: JsonUtils Chọn ngôn ngữ là C# Sử dụng Pascal Case cho tên các thuộc tính Dùng Property là JsonProperty Paste đoạn data json của bạn vào đây Nhấn Submit Còn nữa, nếu bạn sử dụng cơ chế Binding, bạn sẽ muốn khai báo kế thừa từ Interface INotifyPropertyChanged Và bộ công cụ Resharper sẽ giúp ích cho bạn Đọc thêm về Resharper ở đây: [Windows Phone – Silverlight] Layout with XAML – Basic for Absolute Beginner – Part 2, phần 2.1 4.2 Load Data ở đâu trong code behind?Load data là việc bắt buộc phải làm. Nhưng load data ở đâu? Nếu đặt nhầm chỗ, ứng dụng của bạn sẽ chậm phản hồi tới người dùng, và sẽ bị bad review Và có hẳn một bài blog viết về nó: [Windows Phone] Where to put load data method? Thế là xong rồi, hãy dùng kiến thức bạn có trong bài Layout with XAML để bắt đầu thiết kế và tạo nên ứng dụng Windows Phone thực sự đầu tiên của bạn Chúc vui ;)","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"}],"tags":[{"name":"windows phone","slug":"windows-phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-phone/"},{"name":"windows store","slug":"windows-store","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-store/"}]},{"title":"[Basic for Absolute Beginner] – [Part 3] – App’s Structure and how customized it","slug":"basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-3-apps-structure-and-how-customized-it","date":"2014-02-26T14:19:49.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/02/26/basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-3-apps-structure-and-how-customized-it/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/02/26/basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-3-apps-structure-and-how-customized-it/","excerpt":"Chào các bạn, Sau đợt nghỉ lễ dài, hôm nay mình giới thiệu phần 3 của loạt bài viết [Basic for Absolute Beginner] Phần 1 nói về các control cơ bản là Grid và StackPanel: [Windows Phone–Silverlight] Layout with XAML–Basic for Absolute Beginner – Part 1 Phần 2 nói về thiết kế giao diện với XAML: [Windows Phone – Silverlight] Layout with XAML – Basic for Absolute Beginner – Part 2 Tại sao tôi lại nói 2 phần này trước cả App’s Structure.

Cách thức ứng dụng hoạt động trên thiết bị 2. Cấu trúc của ứng dụng 2.1 Các thành phần 2.1.1 Giao diện chính 2.1.2 Properties 2.1.3 References 2.1.4 Assets 2.1.5 Resource 2.1.6 App.xaml và App.xaml.cs 2.1.7 LocalizedString.cs 2.1.8 MainPage.xaml và MainPage.xaml.cs 1. Cách thức ứng dụng hoạt động trên thiết bịKhi cài ứng dụng lên thiết bị, bạn sẽ có một mô hình như sau: Áp dụng cho Windows Phone 7 và Windows Phone 8. Hứa hẹn sẽ có thay đổi lớn trong Windows Phone 8.1 Các mũi tên màu vàng biểu thị cho khả năng truy xuất Nhìn hình trên, bạn sẽ thấy Ứng dụng của bạn chỉ được phép truy cập vào Isolated Storage của chính nó mà thôi (Cái tên Isolated tức là “Cô lập”) Ngoài ra, nếu muốn truy cập vào thẻ nhớ, ứng dụng của bạn bắt buộc phải thông qua API của hệ điều hành. Hiện tại thì Windows Phone chỉ mới cho phép đọc ghi các file media (nhạc, hình, video) lên thẻ nhớ mà thôi. 2. Cấu trúc của ứng dụngMở Visual Studio 2013 lên, bạn sẽ thấy giao diện như sau: Bấm chọn New Project, chọn Windows Phone &gt; Windows Phone App Một số loại Project khác bạn sẽ có cơ hội thực tập với nó sau Ở bên dưới, có 2 tùy chọn khá vui Create directory for Solution: Solution của bạn sẽ được đặt trong một folder “mẹ”, và Project sẽ được đặt trong folder “con” Nói thêm một chút về các thể loại Project của Visual Studio: Khi tạo mới, bạn sẽ tạo một Solution (đuôi file .sln). Và toàn bộ Project của bạn sẽ nằm trong Solution đó. Một Solution có thể chứa nhiều Project. Vậy tại sao bạn lại cần nhiều Project trong 1 Solution? Vì mỗi Project sẽ tạo ra một module khác nhau của hệ thống. Có thể Project chính của bạn là một ứng dụng nghe nhạc, và Project phụ sẽ là một module cho phép cập nhật ngầm, tự động thông tin bài nhạc, hình album vân vân Add to source control: Source Control là một thuật ngữ cho một loại công cụ giúp bạn quản lý code của mình được hiệu quả. Microsoft có một công cụ Source Control là Team Foundation Server. Các bài viết sau sẽ nói về nó nhé Nhấn Ok để tạo Project Trên đây là giao diện sau khi tạo (của bạn có thể không giống lắm) 2.1 Các thành phần2.1.1 Giao diện chính Đây là designer, hiển thị trực quan những gì bạn code trong file XAML XAML, code định nghĩa giao diện của bạn. Cột bên phải là thanh cuộn cải tiến có từ Visual 2012 3 nút này có chức năng thay đổi cách bố cục. Nhấn thử và bạn sẽ biết Còn đây là Solution Explorer, chứa cấu trúc tập tin trong Project của bạn 2.1.2 PropertiesMở Properties ra, bạn sẽ thấy có 3 file Đối với người mới bắt đầu, bạn chỉ cần quan tâm tới “WMAppManifest.xml” là được. Double click vào nó để mở ra Mục Application UI định nghĩa cho tên gọi, các Icon của ứng dụng Mục Capabilities định nghĩa những tài nguyên mà ứng dụng sử dụng như Camera, thư viện nhạc, hình, video, các loại cảm biến, mạng Internet, etc. Ứng dụng của bạn cần sử dụng cái gì thì tick chọn cái đó. Đừng tick dư Requirement là những tài nguyên mà ứng dụng bạn “đòi” để có thể chạy được, ví dụ như NFC, Gyroscope Tại sao vậy? Vì không hẳn tất cả các máy Windows Phone đều như nhau. Có máy có camera trước, có máy không có, blah blah blah. Nếu ứng dụng của bạn nhất thiết phải đòi có những tài nguyên đó, bạn hãy tick vào các ô này. Trên Windows Phone Store, tất cả các máy có cấu hình không đáp ứng được đòi hỏi của bạn sẽ không thể tải được. Và cái cuối cùng dành cho việc đóng gói và hỗ trợ đa ngôn ngữ. Hiện thời bạn chưa cần quan tâm tới nó 2.1.3 ReferencesReferences là thư mục chứa các thư viện mà ứng dụng của bạn sẽ sử dụng Đa phần các thư viện này có thể cài đặt bằng NuGet Tham khảo bài viết sau: [Visual Studio] NUGET the Magician Double click vào một thư viện sẽ cho bạn xem toàn bộ các class và method có trong thư viện đó (máy bạn nào yếu không nên bấm vào, treo máy đấy) Tính năng này được gọi là Object Explorer, đã có từ lâu rồi 2.1.4 AssetsThư mục Assets chứa các tập tin hình ảnh, icon, âm thanh, video mà ứng dụng bạn sẽ sử dụng. Thực ra bạn không bị bắt buộc phải để cá tập tin đó vào thư mục này, nhưng cứ làm vậy cho nó có hệ thống Nhấn chuột phải vào một tập tin nào đó và nhấn Property, bạn sẽ thấy thuộc tính của tập tin này. Thuộc tính quan trọng nhất là Build Action và Copy to output folder Tham khảo bài viết sau để hiểu rõ về chúng: [Windows Phone – Silverlight] - Khác nhau giữa “resource” và “content” Để thêm một tập tin nào đó vào thư mục này, chỉ đơn giản là nhấn phải &gt; Add &gt; Existing Item… 2.1.5 ResourceThư mục Resource chứa file Resource của ứng dụng. File Resource thường được dùng để lưu các thông số, thuộc tính vân vân của ứng dụng. Tuy nhiên công dụng lớn nhất của nó là dùng để chuyển đổi ứng dụng của bạn thành ứng dụng đa ngôn ngữ. Ta sẽ nói về nó sau 2.1.6 App.xaml và App.xaml.csĐối với mỗi một file XAML sẽ có một file XAML.CS đi kèm. File XAML định nghĩa giao diện, còn CS sẽ định nghĩa cách thức hoạt động File App.xaml và App.xaml.cs sẽ định nghĩa việc khởi tạo ứng dụng của bạn, khi mở lên như thế nào, đóng ứng dụng thì như thế nào, vân vân. Bạn sẽ cần tới nó trong một số trường hợp sau này. Bạn có thể mở nó lên để xem thử 2.1.7 LocalizedString.csFile này cho phép ứng dụng hỗ trợ đa ngôn ngữ. Code trong file này do Visual Studio tự sinh ra, bạn không cần phải chỉnh sửa nó 2.1.8 MainPage.xaml và MainPage.xaml.csCuối cùng, đây là trang giao diện đầu tiên của ứng dụng. File MainPage.xaml sẽ được mở sẵn sau khi tạo mới ứng dụng Như vậy, bạn đã hiểu rõ các thành phần cấu tạo nên một ứng dụng Windows Phone, áp dụng bài viết số 1 và số 2, hãy bắt tay vào thiết kế ngay cho bạn một ứng dụng Windows Phone hữu ích nào đó nhé","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"}],"tags":[{"name":"windows phone","slug":"windows-phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-phone/"},{"name":"app","slug":"app","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/app/"},{"name":"beginner","slug":"beginner","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/beginner/"},{"name":"structure","slug":"structure","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/structure/"}]},{"title":"[Basic for Absolute Beginner] - [Part 2] - Layout with XAML","slug":"windows-phone-silverlight-layout-with-xaml-basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-2","date":"2014-01-21T03:55:07.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/01/21/windows-phone-silverlight-layout-with-xaml-basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-2/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/01/21/windows-phone-silverlight-layout-with-xaml-basic-for-absolute-beginner-part-2/","excerpt":"Đây là phần 2 của loạt bài viết Layout with XAML – Basic for Absolute Beginner Bài 1 ở đây: [Windows Phone – Silverlight] Layout with XAML – Basic for AbsoluteBeginner - Part 1 Như các bạn đã biết, ngoài Stackpanel và Grid ra, XAML còn có 1 control cơ bản khác, đó là ListBox (và GridView, ListView, nếu bạn đang lập trình cho Windows 8 hay các ứng dụng WPF) Trong phạm vi bài viết này, mình sẽ đề cập tới ListBox cùng cách thiết kế nó trên giao diện.","text":"Đây là phần 2 của loạt bài viết Layout with XAML – Basic for Absolute Beginner Bài 1 ở đây: [Windows Phone – Silverlight] Layout with XAML – Basic for AbsoluteBeginner - Part 1 Như các bạn đã biết, ngoài Stackpanel và Grid ra, XAML còn có 1 control cơ bản khác, đó là ListBox (và GridView, ListView, nếu bạn đang lập trình cho Windows 8 hay các ứng dụng WPF) Trong phạm vi bài viết này, mình sẽ đề cập tới ListBox cùng cách thiết kế nó trên giao diện.

LISTBOX CONTROL ListBox control dùng để hiện thị một danh sách các item. Danh sách này sẽ có một giao diện nhất định, một kiểu dữ liệu nhất định tùy bạn chọn Ví dụ: “Top 30 video được xem nhiều nhất trên youtube” là một dạng dữ liệu mà ta sẽ dùng ListBox để hiển thị 1.1. Các thuộc tính quan trọng 1.1.1. ItemsSource ItemsSource là nguồn dữ liệu. Listbox này sẽ hiển thị dữ liệu từ đâu? ItemsSource có thể là một List hoặc một ObservableCollection, ta sẽ nói đến nó ở phần sau 1.1.2. SelectedIndex Cái tên đã nói lên tất cả. Đây là item đang được chọn trong listbox của bạn. Trong quá trình khởi tạo, giá trị này sẽ là -1 Lưu ý rằng item bắt đầu từ số 0 trở đi. Giả sử bạn có 5 items, thì nó sẽ được đánh số từ 0 tới 4 1.1.3. SelectedItem Đây lại là một thuộc tính khác. Giá trị của thuộc tínhnày bằng null khi khởi tạo. Và khi người dùng chọn một item nào đó trong listbox, item đó sẽ được phản xạ sang thuộc tính này. Thuộc tính này có kiểu dữ liệu là Object, khi dùng bạn phải ép kiểu sang kiểu dữ liệu của danh sách 1.1.4. DataConext – ngữ cảnh dữ liệu DataContext sẽ được dùng trong một số trường hợp advance binding, hiện tại thì bạn chưa cần phải quan tâm tới nó 1.2. Thử nghiệm Tạo một project Windows Phone Trong LayoutRootGrid, tạo một Listbox Chọn thẻ Property khi đang select listbox này Trong mục Items, bạn thêm mới một số item cho listbox Sau đó, chọn Listbox Item, rồi nhấn nút Add Như bạn có thể thấy, một item với index &#x3D; xuất hiện cùng thuộc tính của nó Rồi thêm vào content như hình sau: Nhấn nút chạy thử, và bạn sẽ thấy cách hoạt động của listbox http://youtu.be/8cu_REIkxPQ Bây giờ bạn đã nắm cách thức Listbox hoạt động cơ bản nhất. Ta hãy cùng “Đào sâu” vào thế giới XAML nhé 2. DataBinding – Phương pháp tuyệt vời để hiển thị dữ liệu Listbox được dùng nhiều nhất với kỹ thuật DataBinding này (tạm dịch là gắn kết dữ liệu đi) Kỹ thuật này cho phép bạn hiển thị dữ liệu từ một nguồn nào đó lên trên listbox. Nguồn đó có thể là một List, hoặc một Observable Collection Nhiều người khi nghĩ tới DataBinding, họ sẽ nghĩ ngay tới mô hình MVVM. Khoan đã, trong vai một người mới học, hẳn bạn cũng sẽ không biết MVVM là cái gì, mặt mũi nó ra sao. Vì vậy, hãy tìm hiểu một số khái niệm và cách thức cơ bản trước đã 2.1. Chuẩn bị Để thực hiện theo bài viết này, bạn cần có các công cụ sau: Visual Studio, chắc cái này bạn có rồi ReSharper: hỗ trợ cho bạn tự động hóa các công việc nhàm chán nhưng cần thiết. Lưu ý đây là phần mềm thương mại Sau khi cài ReSharper, hãy tiếp tục bài viết nhé 2.2. Kiểu dữ liệu Để gắn dữ liệu lên ListBox, ta cần phải có một “Nguồn dữ liệu”, và nguồn dữ liệu đó phải được tạo ra bởi một kiểu dữ liệu nào đó, vì nó là một danh sách các item Ví dụ: một danh sách các chuỗi, một danh sách các số nguyên Tuy nhiên, bạn cũng có thể tạo ra kiểu dữ liệu riêng của mình, như kiểu “Danh sách các món ăn” Vậy tạo ra kiểu dữ liệu như thế nào? Tạo một Folder mới, đặt tên là Model Hãy tạo một file class mới trong folder đó với tên gọi DataStructure Một class DataStructure mới được tạo ra. Bạn có thể xóa nó đi, và bắt đầu định nghĩa cho class riêng của mình Theo như hình trên, bạn có 3 thuộc tính private. Khoan đã, private không thể truy cập ngoài class, nên ta cần tạo các public property cho chúng Trước khi tạo các public property, ta nên làm một chuyện khác, đó là khai báo Interface INotifyPropertyChanged Interface này giúp cho việc binding dữ liệu lên giao diện được “liên tục”. Tức là khi có một sự thay đổi về mặt dữ liệu trong nguồn dữ liệu, sự thay đổi đó sẽ lập tức được hiển thị trên giao diện. Giả sử như bạn có 5 FoodItem, với 5 tên khác nhau. Bạn muốn thay đổi tên của item thứ 2, bạn chỉ cần truy xuất tới item 2 và thay đổi giá trị của thuộc tính foodName, trên giao diện sẽ tự động thay đổi theo mà không cần thêm một dòng code nào cả Okie, khai báo thuộc tính nào Bạn phải bắt buộc khai báo thêm 1 event và một Method trong class của mình sau khi khai báo Interface protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null) &#123; PropertyChangedEventHandler handler = PropertyChanged; if (handler != null) &#123; handler(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); &#125; &#125; Nếu bạn có ReShaper, thì mọi việc đơn giản hơn nhiều Tiếp tục chọn Yes nhé Và bạn sẽ thấy kết quả Lưu ý là ReSharper sẽ thêm một file vào Property của Project bạn đang viết File Dropbox cho bạn nào không có ReSharper: https://db.tt/ycsvjt1S Rồi, bây giờ ta sẽ tạo các Public Property Một lần nữa, ReSharper sẽ giúp ích chúng ta. Đặt con trỏ vào dưới các thuộc tính Private, chọn ReShaper &gt; Edit &gt; Generate Code… Chọn Property cho hộp thoại hiện ra Check cả 3 thuộc tính, check luôn tùy chọn “Notify on Property Changes” Thế là bạn có 3 thuộc tính đúng chuẩn như sau 2.3. Nguồn dữ liệu Bạn đã có 1 kiểu dữ liệu, bây giờ bạn sẽ cần 1 nguồn dữ liệu Tạo một Folder mới tên Data Tạo một class mới tên StaticData trong Folder đó Khai báo một biến static ObservableCollection Khi có ReSharper, nó sẽ tự động thêm các Namespace cần thiết cho bạn. Ở đây, class FoodItem thuộc namespace TestAd.Model Kết quả là bạn có như sau: 2.4. Nạp dữ liệu Bây giờ, ta sẽ nạp dữ liệu vào ObservableCollection này Mở file code behind của page có chứa listbox mà bạn đã tạo trong phần 1 Khai báo như sau, bạn sẽ thấy kiểu khai báo này quen thuộc trong bài: [Windows Phone] Where to put LoadData method Bước 1: kiểm tra dữ liệu đã tồn tại Đặc trưng cơ bản của cách khai báo LoadData như thế này là khi ta navigate tới trang này, hoặc có sự thay đổi về elements trên giao diện, event OnLoaded sẽ được gọi lại. Vì vậy, ta chỉnh sửa event OnLoaded để ngăn ngừa việc load lại dữ liệu như sau: private void OnLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs routedEventArgs) &#123; if (StaticData.FoodItemCollection.Count == 0) &#123; LoadData(); &#125; &#125; Thêm một số code như sau vào hàm LoadData private void LoadData() &#123; for (int i =0;i &lt;5;i++) &#123; FoodItem foodItem =new FoodItem(); foodItem.Id = i; foodItem.FoodName =&quot;Food Name is &quot; +i; foodItem.ImageLink =&quot;FoodItem_&quot; + i + &quot;_imageLink&quot;; StaticData.FoodItemCollection.Add(foodItem); &#125; &#125; Mục tiêu của đoạn code trên là add 5 item giả vào FoodItemCollection. 2.5. Binding Vậy ta đã có dữ liệu, có nguồn dữ liệu, có luôn listbox, bây giờ ta sẽ tiến hành binding dữ liệu này vào listbox Việc này được thực hiện bởi 1 dòng code duy nhất. Đặt tên cho listbox của bạn: Sửa event OnLoaded lại như sau: private void OnLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs routedEventArgs) &#123; if (StaticData.FoodItemCollection.Count == 0) &#123; LoadData(); FoodListBox.ItemsSource = StaticData.FoodItemCollection; &#125; &#125; Sau đó, bấm chạy thử trên Emulator hay trên Device tùy thích Và đây chính là thành quả của các bạn 2.6. DataTemplate Vậy là dữ liệu đã được hiển thị trên giao diện, nhưng không theo cách bạn mong muốn Chính vì thế, ta sẽ tạo một DataTemplate cho Listbox, mục đích là để “định nghĩa” cách hiển thị dữ liệu Vào code XAML của bạn, bấm chọn Document Outline Document Outline là nơi thể hiện toàn bộ mọi thứ có trên giao diện của bạn dưới dạng cây Bấm chuột phải vào ListBox của bạn và chọn Đặt tên cho DataTemplate của bạn rồi nhấn OK Nếu bạn chọn Define in Application, DataTemplate này có thể được dùng ở mọi page trong project của bạn mà không cần phải khai báo lại Trong lúc thiết kế, bạn có thể thấy thiết kế của mình được hiển thị trực quan Nhấn chạy một lần nữa, và mọi thứ sẽ đúng như ý bạn 3. Event Handling Vậy là bạn đã có 1 listbox, bây giờ ta sẽ áp dụng một số sự kiện cho nó để thông báo cho người dùng biết họ đã chọn Listbox nào Trong Property của FoodListBox, chọn nút Event Double Click vào event “Selection Changed” để khai báo event Thêm đoạn code sau vào event mới được tạo if (FoodListBox.SelectedIndex != –1) &#123; FoodItem foodItem = FoodListBox.SelectedItem as FoodItem; MessageBox.Show(foodItem.FoodName); &#125; Chạy thử và chọn một item bất kỳ Thật tuyệt vời phải không Vậy là hết rồi, hẹn gặp lại các bạn ở episode tiếp theo của Series Absolute Beginner nhé","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"}],"tags":[{"name":"windows phone","slug":"windows-phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-phone/"},{"name":"layout","slug":"layout","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/layout/"},{"name":"listbox","slug":"listbox","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/listbox/"},{"name":"template","slug":"template","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/template/"},{"name":"xaml","slug":"xaml","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/xaml/"}]},{"title":"[Imagine Cup 2014 – Brain game] January Quiz #1 Now Open","slug":"imagine-cup-2014-brain-game-january-quiz-1-now-open-2","date":"2014-01-21T03:50:39.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.564Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/01/21/imagine-cup-2014-brain-game-january-quiz-1-now-open-2/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2014/01/21/imagine-cup-2014-brain-game-january-quiz-1-now-open-2/","excerpt":"Lần thứ 3 trong kỳ thi Imagine Cup 2014, cuộc thi Brain Game lại mở ra đón nhận thí sinh với kỹ năng search Google tuyệt hảo để trả lời các câu hỏi hóc búa.

Nested Grid – A “Gridception” :3](#12-nested-grid -a-gridception-3) 2. StackPanel 2.1. Bản chất của StackPanel 2.2. Hiển thị StackPanel vượt quá màn hình 1. Basic Control – Nest ControlTrong XAML, bạn có 2 control chính dùng để “chứa” các control khác, đó là Grid và StackPanel 2 control này khá khác nhau, ở bảng dưới | Grid | StackPanel ||————————————– |——————————————————————- || Các control con có thể đè lên nhau | Các control con xếp theo hàng dọc hoặc ngang, không đè lên nhau || Có thể chia thành dòng và cột | Không có || Tự động mở rộng theo control chứa nó | Mở rộng theo nội dung bên trong nó | Hãy tạo một Project Windows Phone mới và thử nghiệm những gì Grid có thể làm được Trong MainPage.xaml, hãy để ý giao diện mở đầu của nó. Bây giờ, hãy mạnh dạn Delete hết, chỉ chừa lại cái “LayoutRoot” Grid thôi nhé Đây là Grid Control, nó có thể chứa các control khác bên trong, và các control này mặc định sẽ nằm đè lên nhau. Thêm những dòng sau đây vào LayoutRoot Grid Và để ý sự thay đổi ở giao diện Như bạn có thể thấy, 2 dòng TextBlock với FontSize khác nhau này nằm đè lên nhau trong giao diện Khoan đã, tại sao tôi lại cần tới khả năng này của Grid? Tôi không cần bất cứ control nào nằm đè lên nhau trong ứng dụng của tôi cả. Có đấy bạn: Hãy xem hình dưới đây Logo Windows nằm chìm bên dưới, dòng chữ Hello world nổi lên trên, cũng khá hay phải không. Tôi tin chắc rằng bạn sẽ tìm ra nhiều cách hay ho hơn để tận dụng khả năng này của Grid 1.1. Grid.ColumnDefinition and Grid.RowDefinitionNhư trong bảng so sánh ở trên, Grid Control có thể chia không gian bên trong nó ra thành nhiều dòng và cột Grid.RowDefinition là một tag định nghĩa chia dòng cho Grid RowDefintion đi liền với thuộc tính Height Các con số trong thuộc tính Height là số Pixel mà Row đó được định nghĩa Danh sách các Row được đánh số thứ tự, bắt đầu từ 0 Trong các control con bên trong Grid, ta khai báo nó thuộc về dòng nào bằng cách khai báo thêm thuộc tính Grid.Row&#x3D;”Số thứ tự dòng” Và đây là giao diện Tương tự như vậy với ColumnDefintion Cùng điểm lại một chút. Trong thuộc tính Width của ColumnDefinition hoặc thuộc tính Height của RowDefinition, bạn sẽ thấy ngoài việc xác lập một con số, ta còn có thể xác lập nó thành “Auto” hoặc “*“. Đâu là điểm khác biệt giữa các xác lập này? 1.1.1. Fixed SizeFixed Size là một con số. Như bạn thấy ở hình trên, ta có 3 column, column 0 &#x3D; 60 pixel, column 1 &#x3D; 70 pixel, column 2 &#x3D; 150 pixel Điều này có nghĩa là dù bạn làm gì giao diện đi nữa, ta vẫn luôn luôn có 3 cột với 3 “số đo” như trên. Điều gì xảy ra khi bạn mở rộng màn hình, đối với Windows Phone là bạn có 1 devices có độ phân giải cao hơn nhiều? Đối với các ứng dụng WPF và Silverlight, kích thước mà hình không được định sẵn, khi mở rộng, 3 cột với 3 số đo như trên vẫn sẽ giữ nguyên không thay đổi. Tức là bạn sẽ có một vùng đen rất rộng phía bên phải, và 3 cột chen chúc nhau ở bên trái Đối với Windows Phone, theo như một số tài liệu MSDN, 3 cột này sẽ giữ nguyên vị trí, ứng dụng của bạn đơn giản chỉ là được scale up bằng độ phân giải của máy thôi. 1.1.2. Auto SizeĐối với cột Auto, ta sẽ có 1 thứ khác. Hãy thử thay đổi cột đầu tiên thành Auto, và bạn sẽ thấy rõ. Cột đầu tiên được mở rộng đúng bằng với chiều rộng dòng chữ bên trong nó phải không? Đó chính là công dụng của Auto Size. Auto sẽ cho phép tạo ra cột với độ rộng bằng nội dung chứa bên trong nó. Nhưng hãy cẩn thận, khi nội dung quá dài, cột sẽ tự động mở rộng và đôi khi vượt quá màn hình của máy 1.1.3. Star SizeStar Size lại là một chuyện vui. Hãy thử vui một chút, tạo thật nhiều Grid con bên trong một grid lớn và xem chuyện gì xảy ra nhé 3 cột đầu tiên, mỗi cột có fixed size &#x3D; 50 pixel Cột thứ 4 có Width &#x3D; “*“ &#x3D;&gt; Cột thứ 4 sẽ chiếm hết toàn bộ chiều rộng còn lại. Bây giờ, hãy thay đổi code một chút, nhiều điều thú vị đang chờ bạn Một con số trước dấu * mang ý nghĩa phần. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 &#x3D; 10 phần, và cột đầu tiên chiếm 1&#x2F;10, cột thứ 2 chiếm 2&#x2F;10, cột 3 chiếm 3&#x2F;10, cột 4 chiếm 4&#x2F;10. Cho dù thiết bị của bạn có độ phân giải cao đến đâu, hoặc Grid mẹ có kích thước như thế nào, phần trăm mỗi cột chiếm dụng là không đổi. Thật tuyệt phải không 1.2. Nested Grid – A “Gridception” :3Hãy thử vui một chút, tạo thật nhiều Grid con bên trong một grid lớn và xem chuyện gì xảy ra nhé Màu sắc chói lóa. Như vận bạn có thể thấy, trong một Grid có thể chứa thêm nhiều Grid khác nữa, và trong các Grid con lại có thể chứa thêm các Grid con. Điều này là vô hạn miễn là máy bạn đủ khả năng render ra hình ảnh. Nhưng tôi đoán chắc các bạn không cần nhiều hơn 5 lớp Grid đâu 2. StackPanelStackPanel khá giống với Grid ở mặt chứa được nhiều control khác bên trong nó, nhưn stackpanel không thể chia dòng và cột Sửa lại như sau Khoan, tất cả các Grid màu đi đâu hết rồi :( Hãy quay lại với bản chất của StackPanel 2.1. Bản chất của StackPanelMặc định, StackPanel sẽ có chiều rộng &#x2F; chiều cao đúng bằng nội dung chứa bên trong nó. Như vậy, với 4 cái Grid ở trên đều không có kích thước, tức là sẽ có kích thước mặc định. Nếu 4 Grid đó được chứa trong 1 Grid lớn, thì nó sẽ được tự động bung ra tràn đầy Grid mẹ. Nhưng với StackPanel, 4 Grid này sẽ bị thu nhỏ lại thành 0. Bằng cách lập kích thước cho mỗi Grid, ta sẽ thấy điều kỳ diệu xảy ra 4 Grid của chúng ta đã hiển thị, và xếp hàng theo chiều dọc. Bây giờ, bạn thêm thuộc tính Orientation&#x3D;”Horizontal” vào StackPanel, và sửa Height thành Width Như vậy, ta có thể thấy StackPanel sẽ thu gọn tối đa theo chiều chính, và mở rộng ra hết control mẹ ở chiều còn lại. 2.2. Hiển thị StackPanel vượt quá màn hình Tôi đang chọn một vật thể nằm ngoài màn hình. Thêm một ScrollViewer sẽ giải quyết vấn đề","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"},{"name":"Windows Store App","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone/Windows-Store-App","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/Windows-Store-App/"}],"tags":[{"name":"auto","slug":"auto","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/auto/"},{"name":"column","slug":"column","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/column/"},{"name":"columndefinition","slug":"columndefinition","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/columndefinition/"},{"name":"grid","slug":"grid","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/grid/"},{"name":"stackpanel","slug":"stackpanel","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/stackpanel/"},{"name":"star size","slug":"star-size","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/star-size/"}]},{"title":"[Visual Studio] NUGET the Magician","slug":"visual-studio-nuget-the-magician","date":"2013-11-11T14:20:58.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.563Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/11/11/visual-studio-nuget-the-magician/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2013/11/11/visual-studio-nuget-the-magician/","excerpt":"Khi sử dụng Visual Studio để lập trình, chắc hẳn sẽ có lúc bạn cần thêm các thư viện từ bên ngoài.

Vậy cách nào là tối ưu để load data?","text":"Lập trình ứng dụng cho Windows Phone, bắt buộc phải load data và hiển thị chúng lên giao diện. Vậy cách nào là tối ưu để load data? Cách 1: this.Loaded event handler Hoạt động Cách dùng Ưu điểm Nhược điểm Kết luận Cách 2: OnNavigatedTo Hoạt động Cách dùng Ưu điểm Nhược điểm Kết luận Tóm lại Khi tạo mới một page trong Windows Phone, bạn có 1 số phương thức được khởi tạo sẵn Đây là phương thức khởi tạo (Contructor) Phương thức khởi tạo có chức năng chính là…construct, hay xây dựng, thi công nên trang mà mình mong muốn. Một sai lầm cơ bản là mọi người thường load dữ liệu ngay dưới phương thức này. Giả sử như data của bạn nhiều, LoadData chạy khá lâu. Lúc đó thì page của bạn sẽ chỉ xuất hiện khi toàn bộ Contructor đã chạy xong. Tức là từ page cũ, bấm sang page này, sẽ có một khoảng thời gian ứng dụng bị “đơ”, đó chính là thời gian cần thiết để chạy phương thức khởi tạo page. Windows Phone ko hoạt động theo kiểu HTML, một khi tất cả đã sẵn sàng trong RAM, nó mới vẽ page đó ra trên màn hình, trong khi HTML là có cái jì là nó vẽ cái đó :3 Rất nhiều người sử dụng cách này, vì trong một số đoạn video và hầu hết các tài liệu chính thức trên MSDN, MS hướng dẫn bạn theo cách này &#x3D;&#x3D;’ 1. Cách 1: this.Loaded event handler1.1. Hoạt độngLoaded event sẽ được gọi ngay khi vẽ xong giao diện của page lên màn hình (sau khi khởi tạo xong) và khi có một sự thay đổi về giao diện (thêm bớt các element) 1.2. Cách dùng Dùng như hình trên 1.3. Ưu điểmWindows Phone sử dụng cơ chế DataBinding, giao diện sẽ tự động thay đổi khi dữ liệu thay đổi. Hãy thử tưởng tượng từng item xuất hiện trong list, và bạn có thể tương tác với chúng. Phương pháp này làm được việc đó Việc khởi tạo page vô cùng nhanh chóng, ứng dụng của bạn sẽ không bị đơ, đảm bảo tương tác với người dùng 1.4. Nhược điểmBất kỳ khi nào có một sự thay đổi về giao diện (thêm bớt các element), phương thức này sẽ được gọi lại. Như vậy, ta không thể đảm bảo được rằng trong suốt quá trình tương tác trên page, phương thức này chỉ được gọi 1 lần. Gọi nhiều lần hàm load sẽ dẫn tới những kết cục không mong muốn, chưa kể đến sự hao phí tài nguyên và năng lượng Giả sử nếu bạn cần thời gian rất lâu để load dữ liệu, mà dữ liệu của bạn chưa được binding trước khi load xong, thì sẽ có 1 hiện tượng là page đã vẽ xong, nhưng nội dung thì vẫn trống trơn. Dù vẫn phản hồi tốt, người dùng sẽ tưởng app lỗi và rate thấp :3 1.5. Kết luậnNếu page của bạn, bạn chắc chắn không có sự thêm bớt về giao diện, có thể dùng phương thức này. Một lưu ý nhỏ là hãy binding dữ liệu trước khi tiến hành load dữ liệu lên. Binding lên một Collection không có phần tử hoàn toàn không sao cả. (không phải collection null nhé) Nếu dùng phương thức này mà gặp một số lỗi lạ về dữ liệu, hãy nghĩ tới trường hợp event được gọi nhiều lần 2. Cách 2: OnNavigatedTo2.1. Hoạt độngOnNavigatedTo được gọi khi một page trở thành page active trong frame. Như vậy có nghĩa là nó sẽ được gọi trước khi event loaded xảy ra. Thứ tự: Contructor &#x3D;&gt; OnNavigatedTo &#x3D;&gt; Loaded 2.2. Cách dùng 2.3. Ưu điểmOnNavigatedTo có một số tham số liên quan tới việc chuyển page. Bạn có thể dùng các tham số này để xác định các thành phần sẽ hiển thị lên page như thế nào 2.4. Nhược điểmPage cũ sẽ bị đơ trước khi chuyển 2.5. Kết luậnChỉ dùng phương thức này khi thời gian đơ là không đáng kể. Nếu bạn load 2 dòng dữ liệu thì okie, còn nếu 20000 dòng thì nên dùng Loaded 3. Tóm lạiTùy và lượng dữ liệu, cũng như thời gian mà bạn sử dụng linh hoạt 1 trong 2 phương pháp","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"}],"tags":[{"name":"data","slug":"data","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/data/"},{"name":"loaded","slug":"loaded","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/loaded/"},{"name":"onnavigatedto","slug":"onnavigatedto","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/onnavigatedto/"}]},{"title":"[Windows Phone] - TextBlock Tips and Tricks – Part 2 – TextBox too","slug":"windows-phone-textblock-and-textbox-tips-and-tricks-part-2","date":"2013-10-13T03:58:57.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.563Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/10/13/windows-phone-textblock-and-textbox-tips-and-tricks-part-2/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2013/10/13/windows-phone-textblock-and-textbox-tips-and-tricks-part-2/","excerpt":"Ở phần trước, bạn đã có một số tips and tricks khá thú vị phải ko?

Selectable TextBlock 1. Text quá dài và vấn đề bị mất chữ Chữ bị mất một cách vô cùng kỳ quái phải không? 1.1. Nguyên nhânTất cả các control trong Windows Phone đều có 1 giới hạn kích thước mặc định: 2000 pixel 2000 pixel lớn tới mức nào? màn hình laptop tiêu chuẩn là 1366 x 768. So sánh với 2000 x 2000. Vậy là hơn gấp đôi nhưng đối với một số máy Windows Phone có độ phân giải Full HD (1900 x 1080), thì chỉ cần nhân đôi chiều rộng của máy ra là ta sẽ có 1 kích thước tối đa sao? Không phải vậy. Kích thước 2k chỉ áp dụng cho app Windows Phone 7 1.2. Khắc phụcCách khắc phục rất đơn giản. Chia text của bạn ra nhiều phần, và gắn chúng vào các textblock khác nhau. Bao các textblock này trong ScrollViewer. Xong! 2. Selectable TextBlockTextblock, dĩ nhiên là không select được rồi. Vậy ta sẽ chỉnh một chút cho TextBox giống với TextBlock, để lợi dụng tính “Selectable” của nó add code sau vào resource &lt;Style x:Key=&quot;TextBoxStyle1&quot; TargetType=&quot;TextBox&quot;&gt; &lt;Setter Property=&quot;Background&quot;

Khi Unlock, điện thoại phải bật các kết nối có sẵn (Wifi &#x2F; 3G hoặc cả hai) để nó yêu cầu unlock từ phía Microsoft. Nếu không bật các kết nối này, nó sẽ không kết nối được và tất nhiên là không unlock được.

Giải pháp 3. Kết luận 1. Cài đặtTải và cài tại: Windows Phone Power Tools on CodePlex 2. Sử dụngMở một project Windows Phone bất kỳ, Run with Emulator (hoặc Device) Bạn phải chờ cho ứng dụng bắt đầu chạy trên Emulator hoặc device, sau đó quay lại Power Tools Nhấn Connect, nhớ chọn đúng thiết bị bạn đang build project Thế là xong 2.1. Install | UpdatePhần này cho phép bạn cài đặt một app mới hoặc cập nhật một app sẵn có trên thiết bị. Tất cả mọi thứ bạn cần là Emulator đang chạy (hoặc thiết bị đang được kết nối), file XAP của ứng dụng. Đối với Windows Phone 7, bạn cần có Zune. Bạn chỉ được cài đặt các app chưa được ký bởi store (App ký rồi sẽ ko cài được). Và bạn chỉ được cập nhật các app đang develop 2.2. Dev Apps Mục này cho phép bạn tùy chỉnh nhiều thứ về ứng dụng đang được develop trên thiết bị. 2.3. GuildGuild là mã số của ứng dụng của bạn. Mỗi ứng dụng có một số Guild riêng. Và số này sẽ bị ghi đè khi upload và verified trên store 2.4. NameTên của ứng dụng của bạn. Bạn có thể chỉnh sửa nó để dễ nhìn hơn khi sử dụng Power Tools để dev nhiều app cùng lúc Nhấn Enter sau khi đổi tên, Ứng dụng của bạn đã có tên mới. Bạn phải connect lại một lần nữa tới thiết bị để hiển thị thay đổi này trong Isolated Storage. Nhấn vào nút Connect to a device bên trên cùng của Power Tools và chọn Connect lại 2.5. Isolated Storage Thành phần chính của Power Tools Nếu bạn vẫn thấy ứng dụng của mình là dãy số Guild sau khi đổi tên ở mục Dev Apps, hãy nhấn connect to a device ở trên thanh tiêu đề, kết nối lại với emulator hoặc device, bạn sẽ thấy tên ứng dụng thay đổi đúng như mong muốn Đây chính là Isolated Storage của ứng dụng bạn đang chạy trên máy. Isolated Storage này phản ánh chính xác mọi thứ bạn đang có trên bộ nhớ thật, theo một cấu trúc thư mục. Nhấn vào một file hoặc folder bất kỳ, thông tin của nó sẽ hiện ra 2.6. Nút Getnút get cho phép bạn lấy file bạn đang chọn, và lưu nó trên máy tính. Bạn cũng có thể double click một file để mở nó trực tiếp, nhưng đó chỉ là một bản copy của file bạn đang chọn trong Isolated Storage, mọi thao tác chỉnh sửa đối với file này sẽ không được lưu lại trong Isolated Storage 2.7. Nút Put Filenút này cho phép bạn “đặt” một file vào trong Isolated Storage. Chính xác hơn là copy một file từ máy tính vào Isolated Storage. Tùy chọn Overwrite Existing sẽ ghi đè file trùng tên 2.8. Nút Put Directorynhư nút put file, nhưng thực hiện cho cả một thư mục 2.9. Nút DeleteXóa một file ra khỏi Isolated Storage. Bạn không thể phục hồi nó. Hãy cân nhắc trước khi xóa. Lưu một bản sao của chúng trên máy tính 2.10. Profile (Beta)công cụ này, theo nhà phát triển, sẽ giúp bạn đánh giá ứng dụng của mình. Theo thử nghiệm của tôi, nó hoạt động ko được tốt lắm. Đòi quyền quản trị –&gt; đã cấp quyền quản trị Yêu cầu khởi động lại Power Tools –&gt; đã làm Trong quá trình thử nghiệm, Power Tool bị lỗi và ko thể khởi động lại được.

Bài viết này sẽ nói về sự khác biệt giữa 2 thể loại này, cũng như lợi&#x2F;hại của từng loại 1. Khác nhau 2. Truy xuất 2.1. Hình ảnh thuộc tính Content 2.2. Hình ảnh thuộc tính Resource 3. Chọn cái nào 1. Khác nhaukhác biệt chính là Resource được kèm vào trong file dll, trong khi đó, Content lại trở thành một file riêng, đi kèm với file dll. Bạn tự hỏi, vậy Isolated Storage là gì. Đừng nhầm lẫn, Isolated Storage lại là một khái niệm khác, một bộ nhớ độc lập được tạo ra khi bạn cài đặt ứng dụng Hãy làm một bài test nhỏ. Tạo một project Silverlight (Windows Phone cho dễ :3 ), thêm vào vài cái hình. Rồi chọn resource cho một số hình, và content cho các hình còn lại. Build file XAP. Đổi tên file XAP thành ZIP, giải nén nó ra. Bạn sẽ thấy, những file có thuộc tính content thì nằm ngay bên ngoài. Những file Resource thì đã được nhúng kèm trong dll, nên chúng ta ko thấy nữa. 2. Truy xuấtTruy xuất tới các file resource và content khác nhau một tí 2.1. Hình ảnh thuộc tính ContentContent là một file nằm riêng biệt, nên truy xuất dễ dàng: XAML: &lt;Image Stretch=&quot;None&quot; Source=&quot;/images/yourImage.png&quot;/&gt; C#: Uri uri = new Uri(&quot;/images/yourImage.png&quot;, UriKind.Relative); BitmapImage imgSource = new BitmapImage(uri); 2.2. Hình ảnh thuộc tính ResourceResource, vì nằm trong một file dll, nên truy xuất nó khó khăn hơn nhiều XAML: &lt;Image Source=&quot;/TestProjet;component/images/yourImage.png&quot;/&gt; C#: Uri uri = new Uri(&quot;/TestProjet;component/images/yourImage.png&quot;, UriKind.Relative); this.Image.Source = new BitmapImage(uri); 3. Chọn cái nàoHiểu rồi, giờ bạn sẽ chọn cái nào cho các file thêm vào project? Một file Resource sẽ load nhanh hơn khi bạn truy xuất nó. Tuy nhiên, ứng dụng sẽ khởi động chậm hơn. Và ngược lại, một file Content sẽ load chậm hơn, bù lại, ứng dụng sẽ không phải load file này vào bộ nhớ trong lúc đang khởi động. Nếu bạn cần truy xuất một file rất lớn, mà ứng dụng chưa cần ngay, hay chọn ngay Content. Ngược lại, nếu ứng dụng của bạn cần load file đó ngay khi chạy (ví dụ như Wallpaper chẳng hạn), thì lời khuyên là nên chọn Resource cho nó, vì đằng nào bạn cũng phải load nó lên. Chọn Resource sẽ giảm thiểu hiện tượng ứng dụng load lên được mấy phần trăm giây thì bỗng nhiên Background Image “xuất hiện”","categories":[{"name":"CSharp","slug":"CSharp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/"},{"name":"Windows Phone","slug":"CSharp/Windows-Phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CSharp/Windows-Phone/"}],"tags":[{"name":"windows phone","slug":"windows-phone","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/windows-phone/"},{"name":"content","slug":"content","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/content/"},{"name":"file","slug":"file","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/file/"},{"name":"project","slug":"project","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/project/"},{"name":"resource","slug":"resource","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/resource/"}]},{"title":"[04-09-2013] Dreamspark - Cách gia hạn tài khoản hoặc lấy Registration Code","slug":"dreamspark-gia-han-ti-khoan-hoac-lay-registration-code","date":"2013-09-04T14:46:27.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.563Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/09/04/dreamspark-gia-han-ti-khoan-hoac-lay-registration-code/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2013/09/04/dreamspark-gia-han-ti-khoan-hoac-lay-registration-code/","excerpt":"Nếu bạn chưa có tài khoản Windows Store Dev hoặc Windows Phone Dev, bạn có thể đăng ký 1 cái Lưu ý: yêu cầu phải có thẻ visa Sau khi đăng ký, sẽ tới bước trả phí cho tài khoản.

If you are worried that Microsoft technology is closed and expensive, you are completely mistaken. For students, Microsoft has the MS DreamSpark support program, providing free software licenses to students in information technology universities and colleges worldwide. As an MSP, I also receive an MSDN Subscription account, including licenses for all Microsoft commercial software, along with benefits such as priority access to new software releases, priority participation in Microsoft-organized conferences, and free monthly technology and programming magazines. It can be said that MSP is a gathering of passionate, enthusiastic students who are often very skilled in their respective fields. By participating in MSP, I have had the opportunity to meet and interact with senior students and learn from them, thereby enhancing my knowledge and skills. Every year, Microsoft organizes numerous conferences and technology training courses. As an MSP, I am given priority invitations to attend these events, which are usually exclusive to partners and technical experts. Microsoft also organizes team-building trips for MSPs in the northern and southern regions. In 2012, Vietnamese MSPs had a memorable trip to Da Nang. VietnameseTham gia MSP, tôi đã có cơ hội học hỏi nhiều thứ, thử sức ở các lĩnh vực vô cùng mới mẻ và hấp dẫn, mà sau này là xu hướng công nghệ. Công nghệ thông tin là một lĩnh vực thay đổi liên tục, phát triển từng ngày. MSP sẽ cho bạn cơ hội để tiếp cận những công nghệ mới nhất, tiên tiến nhất, để từ đó, bạn có thể sáng tạo ra những sản phẩm, những tiện ích vô cùng độc đáo. Chương trình MSP thường xuyên tổ chức các Workshop về kỹ thuật lập trình, cũng như những buổi training kỹ năng mềm, các buổi chia sẻ. Tôi đã tham dự nhiều buổi như vậy, ví dụ như Workshop lập trình ứng dụng Windows Phone, training kỹ năng trình bày, buổi chia sẻ YouthSpark với các giám đốc Microsoft khu vực diễn ra gần đây. Nếu bạn đang lo lắng công nghệ của Microsoft là một công nghệ đóng, phải tốn chi phí, bạn đã hoàn toàn sai lầm. Đối với sinh viên, Microsoft có chương trình hỗ trợ MS DreamSpark, cung cấp bản quyền phần mềm miễn phí cho sinh viên các trường đại học – cao đẳng đào tạo công nghệ thông tin trên toàn thế giới. Là MSP, tôi còn được cấp thêm một tài khoản MSDN Subscription, bao gồm bản quyền tất cả phần mềm thương mại của Microsoft, kèm với các lợi ích như được ưu tiên phát hành các phần mềm mới, ưu tiên tham dự các hội thảo do Microsoft tổ chức, hàng tháng nhận các tạp chí về công nghệ và lập trình miễn phí. Có thể nói, MSP là tập hợp các bạn sinh viên có đam mê, nhiệt huyết và thường rất giỏi trong lĩnh vực của mình. Tham gia MSP, tôi đã được gặp gỡ và tiếp xúc với những bậc đàn anh, cũng như học hỏi từ họ, từ đó, nâng cao kiến thức, kỹ năng của mình. Hằng năm, Microsoft tổ chức nhiều buổi hội thảo, các khóa đào tạo công nghệ. Là một MSP, tôi được ưu tiên mời tham dự các sự kiện chỉ dành cho đối tác và các chuyên gia kỹ thuật này. Microsoft cũng tổ chức các chuyến team building dành cho MSP hai miền nam bắc. Năm 2012, MSPs Việt Nam đã có một chuyến đi đáng nhớ tại Đà Nẵng","categories":[{"name":"MSP","slug":"MSP","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/MSP/"}],"tags":[{"name":"-- msp","slug":"msp","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/msp/"}]},{"title":"[IC05] Đăng ký tài khoản Mentor","slug":"ic05","date":"2012-03-08T14:15:13.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.563Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/03/08/ic05/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2012/03/08/ic05/","excerpt":"Các bước đăng ký một tài khoản đúng tiêu chuẩn cho Imagine Cup 2012","text":"Các bước đăng ký một tài khoản đúng tiêu chuẩn cho Imagine Cup 2012 Bước 1: Truy cập trang Imagine Cup: www.imaginecup.com, bấm nút Sign Up Bước 2: Điền các thông tin tương tự hình dưới Thay đổi thông tin cho phù hợp với bạn Lưu ý mục Participant Type: Mentor Sau đó, bấm dấu check đồng ý với các điều khoản, điều kiện của cuộc thi Nhấn nút Register Vậy là xong.","categories":[{"name":"Imagine Cup","slug":"Imagine-Cup","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/Imagine-Cup/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"[IC04] Đăng ký cho Team của bạn [Dành cho Nhóm trưởng]","slug":"ic04","date":"2012-01-31T13:18:08.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.563Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/01/31/ic04/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2012/01/31/ic04/","excerpt":"Sau khi đăng nhập, vào mục Compete &gt; Chọn phần bạn đã đăng ký thi","text":"Sau khi đăng nhập, vào mục Compete &gt; Chọn phần bạn đã đăng ký thi Sau đó, bên tay phải, nhấp vào hình dấu + của mục Team để mở nó ra, bấm vào link “Create a Team” Bạn điền các thông tin cần thiết như hình Team Name: Tên của Team Team Info: điền gì tùy thích Ở cột bên phải, nhấp vào nút hình kính lúp để tìm thành viên Ở bảng hiện ra, gõ tên các thành viên nhóm bạn hoặc chọn Location Vietnam để lọc lại danh sách Sau đó tìm ID của thành viên, bấm nút Add to Team Thế là xong.

Khi biên dịch, file đó có kích thước rất lớn, chương trình chạy chậm, dễ phát sinh lỗi, vân vân và vân vân. Vậy làm thế nào để có thể tách các thành phần trong code ra thành những file riêng? 1. Không nên 2. Nên 3. Ví dụ 4. Tách class thành file riêng 5. Về việc sử dụng Namespace Nếu bạn chưa có nền tảng về lập trình hướng đối tượng bằng C++, hãy quay lại blog này sớm nhất có thể ngay khi bạn đủ khả năng nhé. 1. Không nênViệc tạo class trong file riêng bắt buộc bạn phải dùng câu lệnh include một thư viện nhiều lần. Trong file riêng và trong chương trình chính #include &quot;stdafx.h&quot; #include &quot;iostream&quot; using namespace std; 2. NênKhông cần phải làm như vậy. Việc include một thư viện trùng lặp sẽ phát sinh lỗi. Thay vào đó, trong file header của class, hãy thêm câu lệnh sau: #ifndef TÊNCLASS_H #define TÊNCLASS_H các thư viện cần thiết các dòng lệnh #endif Sau đó, trong hàm main, bạn include thêm file header.h vừa tạo 3. Ví dụĐể giúp các bạn hình dung rõ hơn, bạn có thể xem một số screen shot Khai báo tên class trong PhoneNumber.h Sau đó, trong file định nghĩa các hàm thành viên của PhoneNumber, ta include thêm file PhoneNumber.h Sau cùng là Include nó vào hàm Main. Chương trình sẽ chạy trơn tru Một cách khác mới hơn, đơn giản hơn (nhưng cũng đòi hỏi trình biên dịch là Visual Studio 2005 trở lên) #pragma once Thêm dòng này vào đầu của file .h. Nó sẽ thông báo cho trình biên dịch chỉ include các thư viện 1 lần duy nhất. 4. Tách class thành file riêngĐể minh họa, tôi sẽ tạo một class MyInt đơn giản, dùng để biểu diễn số nguyên Đầu tiên, khởi động Visual Studio Chọn loại Project mong muốn, đặt tên cho nó và nhấn OK Bấm Finish ở Wizard tạo Project Sau đó, Visual Studio (VS) sẽ tạo một project mới cho bạn, với tên bạn đặt và header đã được biên dịch sẵn là stdadx.h Để thêm mới một class bằng cách thông thường, click phải vào Header Files, chọn Add &gt; New Item… Chọn Header File Đặt tên cho nó và nhấn Add Một file mới hoàn toàn có tên MyInt.h được tạo ra. Đây là file dành cho việc khai báo class MyInt. Bạn cũng có thể định nghĩa class trong file này, nhưng việc đó không được khuyến cáo // MyInt class declaration #prama once #include &quot;stdafx.h&quot; class MyInt &#123; private: int data; public: MyInt(); MyInt(int); &#125;; Như bạn có thể thấy, chúng ta sử dụng kỹ thuật #pragma once để tránh include quá nhiều thư viện Tương tự, hãy Add một file MyInt.cpp mới trong thư mục Source Files Sau đó, hãy định nghĩa các thuộc tính và hàm của lớp MyInt trong file MyInt.cpp // MyInt class definition #include &quot;stdafx.h&quot; #include &quot;iostream&quot; using std::cin; #include &quot;MyInt.h&quot; MyInt::MyInt() : data(0) &#123; &#125; MyInt::MyInt(int re) : data(re) &#123; &#125; Ở dòng 7, vì class MyInt được khai báo ở file header MyInt.h, nên bạn phải include nó vào để sử dụng. Thế là xong. Có một cách khác để tạo class trong file riêng bằng Wizard của VS. Trong thư mục Header Files, click phải, chọn Add &gt; Class… Chọn CPP class rồi bấm Add Trong Wizard mới hiện ra, bạn chỉ cần gõ tên class, tên file header và file source sẽ được tạo tự độn Bấm Finish, ngay lập tức, 2 file mới sẽ được tạo, có sẵn code và được phân phối và thư mục tương ứn Code tạo sẵn trong file header MyInt2.h Code tạo sẵn trong file source MyInt2.cpp Như vậy, tất cả công việc ta làm bằng tay đều được VS làm tự động, nhưng nó sinh ra một số code dư thừa. Nhiều lập trình viên không thích điều này, họ vẫn thích tự tạo class file cho mình hơn. 5. Về việc sử dụng NamespaceNhư đã nói ở trên, lập trình hướng đối tượng với VC++ 2010, sinh viên thường #include rất nhiều thư viện dư thừa, rồi sau đó using namespace std; Điều đó không cần thiết. Trong namespace std, tức STANDARD, có rất nhiều hàm xây dựng sẵn mà bạn không cần dùng. Dùng hàm nào, bạn khai báo hàm đó. Ví dụ như hình trên, tôi dùng hàm cout, cin, endl nên chỉ khai báo 3 hàm đó thôi. #include &quot;stdafx.h&quot; #include &quot;iostream&quot; using std::cout; using std::cin; using std::endl; 3 hàm này nằm trong thư viện iostream Một số thư viện thường dùng: stdafx.h – tiêu chuẩn cho VC++ 2010 iostream – chứa các hàm cout, cin, endl string – chứa các hàm xử lý chuỗi iomanip – chứa hàm định khoảng cho output (setw, serfill) conio.h – chứa hàm getch(). Hàm này thường được dùng để dừng màn hình. Nhưng không nên sử dụng nó.","categories":[{"name":"CPlusPlus","slug":"CPlusPlus","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/categories/CPlusPlus/"}],"tags":[{"name":"class","slug":"class","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/class/"},{"name":"Header (computing)","slug":"Header-computing","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Header-computing/"},{"name":"Separate class","slug":"Separate-class","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Separate-class/"},{"name":"Source","slug":"Source","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Source/"},{"name":"Visual Studio","slug":"Visual-Studio","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/tags/Visual-Studio/"}]},{"title":"Đăng ký Imagine Cup 2012","slug":"dang-ky-imagine-cup-2012","date":"2011-12-31T15:19:38.000Z","updated":"2025-08-31T21:04:20.563Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/12/31/dang-ky-imagine-cup-2012/","permalink":"https://huntertran.github.io/blog/2011/12/31/dang-ky-imagine-cup-2012/","excerpt":"Để đăng ký, các bạn trong team phải tạo một tài khoản trên www.imaginecup.com","text":"Để đăng ký, các bạn trong team phải tạo một tài khoản trên www.imaginecup.com Sau đó, đăng nhập tài khoản của mình, tại mục Compete, chọn phần team bạn muốn tham gia Ở đây mình chọn Windows Phone Challenge Ở Việt Nam, bạn có thể chọn: Software Design: Thiết kế phần mềm Game Design: XBOXWINDOWS: Thiết kế game cho X Box Game Design: Phone: Thiết kế game cho Windows Phone 7 Windows Phone Challenge: Thiết kế ứng dụng cho Windows Phone 7 Sau đó, ở trang hiện ra, bấm Sign Up để đăng ký mục thi Cập nhật thông tin cá nhân của bạn Rồi bấm nút Update Profile Sau cùng, bấm nút Send Certification Sau khi có thông báo “A Competition Certificate has been sent to your e-mail address” tức là bạn đã đăng ký thành công.
